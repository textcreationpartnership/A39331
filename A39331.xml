            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And here I cannot but much blame the Officers of our <hi>Trained Bands in London,</hi> of two great neglect:: the firſt, in making men <hi>File-leaders</hi> either out of reſpect, or favour they bear unto them; or elſe becauſe one man hath a better <hi>Buf-coat</hi> than another: I ſpeake not this to encourage any man to come ſlovenly habited when he ſhall march forth with his <hi>Captain,</hi> but rather adviſe all Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to fit themſelves with the beſt array they can, and could wiſh all the <hi>Serjeants</hi> in drawing up their <hi>Files,</hi> to pitch upon ſuch Gentlemen to be <hi>File-leaders,</hi> as may take charge of his <hi>File,</hi> and ſhall be able, willing, and ready upon all convenient times, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and teach his <hi>File</hi> in all their <hi>Poſtures,</hi> and neat handling of their <hi>Arms,</hi> which if carefully obſerved, they would reap the benefit of much eaſe to themſelves and the private Souldiers: readineſſe in the performance of the <hi>Poſtures</hi> would much redound ro the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Captain that ſhall lead them. But for the farther ſatisfaction of the ingenious Souldier that ſhall enquire what <hi>Poſture</hi> is, I ſhall briefly reſolve them thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poſture,</hi> as I conceive, is a <hi>garbe</hi> or <hi>figure</hi> that a man ſtands in, in the handling of his <note place="margin">What <hi>Poſture</hi> is.</note> 
                     <hi>Arms;</hi> which he uſeth for the better grace and becomming of them.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeverall motions belonging to each <hi>Poſture,</hi> which ſome call <hi>Poſtures,</hi> but they much deceive themſelves, as ſhall appear clearly unto them (by the ſurvey) as they ſhall be ſet down in order. And firſt, we will begin to ſet down the <hi>Poſtures</hi> of the <hi>Pike.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Severall reaſons why the</hi> Pike <hi>is the more honourable Arms.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>FIrſt I ſhall begin to ſet down the <hi>poſtures</hi> of the <hi>Pike,</hi> before the <hi>poſtures</hi> of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> for theſe reaſons following, as conceiving: Firſt, They are the more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Arms,</hi> in reſpect the <hi>Colours</hi> flying upon the head of them, and upon the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Company there is the moſt propereſt place for the <hi>Captain</hi> to be, either upon a Stand or upon a March, provided he have ground ſufficient to March them all a breſt. If upon a Stand the Captain ſhall have occaſion to engage againſt an Enemy, thither his Officers may repair unto him upon the head of the <hi>Pikes,</hi> there to receive directions. And if the Captain ſhall cauſe the <hi>Serjeants</hi> to draw off part or all the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> from the Body of <hi>Pikes</hi> to fire againſt the enemy, the Gentlemen of the <hi>Pikes</hi> in the mean time ſtands undauntedly to undergoe all the cruell ſhot of the Cannon from the contrary part for to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Colours, who are likewiſe a place of <hi>Randezvous</hi> for the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to repair unto when they ſhall retreat from fight. Farther, it hath been the ambition of many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, both in <hi>Holland, France,</hi> and in theſe our late unhappy Wars in <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>trail Pikes</hi> with ſeverall Commanders whom they ſhall thinke fit. And laſtly, to conclude all, that the <hi>Pike</hi> is the more honourable <hi>Arms,</hi> it is ſo in reſpect of its antiquity, for there hath been the uſe of the <hi>Pike</hi> and <hi>Spear,</hi> many hundred years before there was any knowledge of the <hi>Musket,</hi> as in many Hiſtories you ſhall finde. And ſo for preſent, I wil conclude this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>Pike,</hi> deſiring the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to have a favourable cenſure of me: for I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not by it to perſwade all Souldiers to the handling of the <hi>Pike,</hi> and none to be <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers,</hi> for that cannot be, I ſhould rather adviſe all <hi>Captains</hi> that have occaſion to raiſe their Companies to have two thirds of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and but one of <hi>Pikes:</hi> that is to ſay, if they ſhould have 18 <hi>Files,</hi> to cauſe twelve of them to carry <hi>Muskets,</hi> and the other ſix <hi>Files Pikes.</hi> And in my judgement they ſhall performe the better ſervice unto any Nation where they ſhall be employ'd; and I ſhall farther deſire the Souldiers (eſpecially thoſe that be of <hi>low</hi> ſtature) to handle and take delight in the uſe of the <hi>Musket;</hi> for it is an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great honour to him ſo to handle his <hi>Musket,</hi> as that he doth it with eaſe and in a comely manner, and he that ſhall become expert therein; I have often obſerved this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to follow him, by the report of others; Such a one is a good <hi>Muskettier,</hi> and an able Souldier; concluding thereby, he that will take the pains to be a good <hi>Muskettier</hi> certainly cannot be idle, but hath gained ſomthing more to make him capable of ſuch praiſe. To conclude, I ſhall deſire the Gentlemen of the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and the Gentlemen of the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to goe hand in hand in love like dear brothers, and neither of them to envie each other, and in ſo doing, God will give a bleſſing to all their undertakings. But now, fearing I have dwelt too long upon this diſcourſe of the <hi>Arms,</hi> I ſhall next proceed to ſet down, firſt the <hi>poſtures</hi> of the <hi>Pike,</hi> then the <hi>poſtures</hi> of the <hi>Musket,</hi> with all the words of command tending to their Motions, after collect them in order in a <hi>brief</hi> way, and then ſet forth unto you the equality of number that the one <hi>Arms</hi> hath with the other, in the <hi>poſtures</hi> as followeth.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40901:14"/> us in our private meetings, but I conceive it to be of little uſe to receive a deſperate charge of the <hi>Horſe,</hi> for by theſe charges the Souldiers are in ſo lame and weake a <hi>poſture,</hi> that the Horſe cannot chooſe if they come on with a full <hi>career,</hi> but beare the <hi>Pikes</hi> and <hi>Pike-men</hi> down to the ground: Therefore in my opinion the beſt way of oppoſing the <hi>Horſe charge</hi> is that which we learned of our ever honoured <hi>Captain, Major Henry Tillier,</hi> in the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Garden;</hi> which was, <hi>Files</hi> cloſing to the midſt to their <hi>cloſeſt Order,</hi> inſomuch that there was not above half a foot <hi>intervall</hi> of ground between <hi>File</hi> and <hi>File,</hi> the <hi>Pikes Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> and after cloſing their <hi>Ranks</hi> forwards ſo cloſe, that they locked themſelves one within another, and then charged on. Which in my judgement is ſo ſecure a way from <hi>routing,</hi> that it is impoſſible for any Body of <hi>Horſe</hi> to enter therein: and farther, to my beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, I never could meet with any Souldier that hath been abroad upon any ſervice that ever ſaw any charging of the <hi>Pikes</hi> at the <hi>Foot,</hi> therefore I will further proceed.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Pike</hi> being ordered is the proper <hi>Poſture</hi> of a Souldier upon a ſtand, which he <note place="margin">The uſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Pike.</note> ought ever to minde upon any ſuch occaſion, ſo to make uſe of it. And I have likewiſe ſeen in many places, in the day time, this <hi>Poſture</hi> to be uſed by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier ſtanding <hi>Sentinell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pike advanced,</hi> is uſefull for the Souldier upon a <hi>Troop,</hi> when they are to <hi>march</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The uſe of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the Pike.</note> ſwiftly, either for the relieving of ſome <hi>Court of Guard,</hi> or to repair to their place of <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous,</hi> or upon ſome ſuddain approaching to an Enemy, to make a <hi>Charge:</hi> for then he will be in a fit capacity to <hi>clap</hi> down quickly his <hi>Pike,</hi> upon the breaſt of the Enemy. It is likewiſe very uſefull in the time of excerciſe: to the <hi>half-files,</hi> and <hi>bringers up,</hi> upon any <hi>doubling</hi> to the Front, for then they are alwayes to be <hi>advanced,</hi> in reſpect of a longer <hi>march</hi> in their <hi>doublings,</hi> then thoſe that <hi>double Ranks and Files;</hi> but having <hi>doubled,</hi> they muſt always conforme in <hi>Poſture</hi> to the part <hi>doubled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uſe of <hi>Porting</hi> was invented for the eaſe of the <hi>Reare half-Files,</hi> upon a <hi>Charge;</hi> for the <hi>Front half-Files</hi> are only for to <hi>charge;</hi> the <hi>Rear haf Files</hi> in the mean time are to <note place="margin">The uſe of Porting.</note> 
                     <hi>port.</hi> It is likewiſe very uſefull at ſuch times when the Souldiers are marching through a <hi>Gate,</hi> or <hi>Sally-Port;</hi> from whence I conceive it doth derive its name <hi>porting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uſe of <hi>ſhouldering</hi> the <hi>Pike,</hi> is only propereſt upon the <hi>March,</hi> and in ſome kinde ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſefull upon a Stand in time of Fight; provided they are at convenient <hi>diſtance</hi> from <note place="margin">The uſe of Shouldering.</note> the Enemy. For it much preſerveth the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and <hi>Pikemen,</hi> from the danger of the <hi>ſhot,</hi> the <hi>bullets</hi> then <hi>gliding</hi> off from their <hi>Arms;</hi> which if they ſtood at ſuch times, either <hi>ordered,</hi> or <hi>advanced;</hi> the <hi>bullets</hi> would make ſuch a <hi>clattering</hi> amongſt the <hi>Pikes,</hi> that what with breaking of them, and the <hi>ſhivers</hi> flying from them, may much endanger the Souldiers which ſhall carry them.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40901:16"/>
                  <p>The <hi>comporting</hi> of the <hi>Pike</hi> is only uſefull to the Souldier marching up a <hi>hill,</hi> for if then <note place="margin">The uſe of Comporting.</note> he ſhould be <hi>ſhoudered,</hi> the <hi>But-end</hi> of the <hi>Pike</hi> would always be touching of the <hi>ground,</hi> to hinder him in his <hi>March;</hi> and much endanger his fellow-ſouldiers that ſhall come after him. Neither can he <hi>march advanced;</hi> for if there ſhould be any winde, it would be ready to blow him down. Therefore as above, that which is moſt commodious for the Souldiers marching up a <hi>hill,</hi> is to <hi>comport his Pike.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>trailing</hi> of the <hi>Pike</hi> is ſeldome uſed, but when the Souldier ſhall <hi>march</hi> ſtraight <note place="margin">The uſe of Trailing.</note> forward through a <hi>Wood,</hi> the <hi>File-leader</hi> before he enters in, <hi>trails</hi> his <hi>Pike,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all the reſt in his <hi>File:</hi> then <hi>ſtooping down,</hi> they take up the <hi>But-end</hi> of their <hi>Leaders Pikes,</hi> which they may eaſily gripe with their own in their right hands, and after <hi>march</hi> forward through the <hi>buſling leaves</hi> in a ſtraight <hi>line,</hi> every <hi>file</hi> ſingle by himſelfe, but as neare each other as poſſible they can <hi>march</hi> for more ſecuritie ſake; that when they are cleare, they may finde each other, and be in a condition to <hi>rally</hi> up againe, as occaſion ſhall require. The <hi>trailing</hi> of the <hi>Pike,</hi> may alſo be of excellent uſe in a <hi>Trench,</hi> that at ſuch time when they ſhall have intelligence, where the Enemy are preparing to make a <hi>Breach,</hi> they may then move forwards unto that place undiſcovered, and may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>cheeking</hi> of the <hi>Pike,</hi> is the proper <hi>Sentinell poſture,</hi> and then to be uſed. <note place="margin">The uſe of Cheeking.</note>

                  <p>THe Souldier now having obteined ſome pretty knowledge, skill, and ready apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the managing and performing the <hi>Poſtures,</hi> begins to look about himſelf, what next is needfull for to faſten upon, to make a further progreſſe in this Art And ſtraight he meets with ſome that <hi>whiſpers</hi> to him, that it were a gallant thing to know the <hi>Dignity</hi> of a <hi>File,</hi> true and rightly ſtated; to which he anſwers, but where can it be found, the opinions of Souldiers are ſo various, and differing therein, that none knows where for to atteine it. My <hi>Captains</hi> eye (ſaith he) is upon me, becauſe I do the <hi>Poſtures</hi> well, which cauſeth the <hi>Serjeants</hi> to make me a <hi>File-leader,</hi> and that I know to be the chiefeſt, and firſt place of Honour in the <hi>File,</hi> the ſecond place to be the <hi>Bringer up,</hi> the third, the <hi>half File leader:</hi> the fourth, the <hi>Bringer</hi> up of the <hi>Front half-Files.</hi> Thus far, no Souldier of any known judgment can deny; but now a days our <hi>Files</hi> being drawn up ſix deep, makes me altogether ignorant of the honour of the Reſt; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know I the Dignity of a File eight, or ten deep, which ſtill in ſome places they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine, drawing them up ſo deep. If my ambition were but now fully ſatisfied herein, I ſhould in time come for to know the Dignity of the Captains, as they are drawn up all in a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by which Rule, I am informed they walk. And in my judgment, there cannot be a truer ſtating the Dignity of a <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>File,</hi> then that which ſhall conforme to the Dignities of the <hi>Captaines,</hi> as they are drawn up a Breſt all in a <hi>Regiment.</hi> Now, for as much, as many <hi>Regiments,</hi> conſiſt of ſeverall Numbers of <hi>Captaines,</hi> and Companies in them; as ſome ſix Companies, others eight; ſome greater, as ten, and twelve Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. It is expedient therefore not only for my ſelfe, but for every Souldier that will be truly knowing to be reſolved herein concerning thoſe ſeverall numbers, and as occaſion ſhall alter to any other; they may informe themſelves by theſe how to fit their purpoſe. And therefore, not to keep the apt and forward Souldier longer in ſuſpence, but that he may proceed, I ſhall amongſt the reſt, declare my thoughts therein, and ſet it forth unto their view, everhoping from my fellow-ſouldiers a favourable cenſure of my good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, and to my Countrey, for to imploy that little talent, which lately my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours hath obteined to do them ſervice. And ſhall forthwith ſet down unto them four Tables of Dignity, both of <hi>Ranks,</hi> and <hi>Files,</hi> which ſhall be firſt of twelve a Breſt, and twelve deep. Secondly, ten a Breſt, and ten deep. Thirdly, eight a Breſt, and eight deep.

                  <p>THat which gives moſt life for the true explaining of the former table is, to ſhew the ſeverall places of honour and dignitie of the Captains, how they are drawn up a breſt all in a Regiment. Be pleaſed therefore to goe along with me, and you ſhall underſtand that the <hi>Collonel</hi> hath the firſt place of honour, as being Commander in chiefe, whoſe Company ſtands upon the right, which makes the figure (1) The ſecond place of honour in the <hi>Regiment</hi> is the <hi>Lieutenant Collonel,</hi> whoſe Company is drawn up upon the left, as being the outmoſt there, and is deſcribed by the figure (2) The third place of honour is the <hi>Majors</hi> Company, which is drawn up upon the right of the left halfe <hi>Ranks,</hi> whoſe place is deſcribed by the figure (3) The fourth place of honour is the eldeſt <hi>Captains</hi> Company; which is drawn up upon the left of the right halfe <hi>Ranks,</hi> and is ſet forth by the figure (4) And now we have proceeded thus far, we will make <hi>Alt</hi> and begin to examine whether we have rightly hitherto proceeded, or no, therefore, for the more cleering and underſtanding herein, you muſt take notice it is the diſcretion of every knowing Commander ſo to aime and ſtate his Battail, as that he makes his Front equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in worth, ſtrength, and dignity to that of the Reer, and with equall proportion of number, and in like manner ſo to order his right half <hi>Ranks</hi> as that they may carry an equall ballance in worth, number and dignity with the left half <hi>Ranks.</hi> Now therefore to begin to make ſome triall or experiment herein by examining the firſt worth with the fourth, and that will make the number (5) and then put to triall the ſecond worth and third, and you ſhall eaſily diſcern it to carry the ſame proportion of number. So that it may appear cleerly in the judgement of any diſcreet Souldier a true and equall proportion, the Front with the Reer, the right half <hi>Ranks</hi> ſutable to the left halfe <hi>Ranks,</hi> and that both in number, honour and dignity.</p>

                  <p>TO give you farther ſatisfaction, and Reaſons for the placing of the ſecond foure, in reſpect it is contrary to the Rule and Judgement of ſome Souldiers: therefore far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerve with me this; When a <hi>Regiment</hi> is drawn up in the true Order of a <hi>Regimentall</hi> way; there is as before expreſſed, two Bodies, or <hi>Stands</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> ſlanked with <hi>Muskettiers;</hi> and it is the Office of every <hi>Major</hi> to give forth in writing notes of paper unto every <hi>Captain,</hi> and <hi>Leiutenant,</hi> where their place ſhall be upon a <hi>Stand,</hi> and where upon a <hi>March,</hi> that he may with more readineſſe know where to lead, and where to fall in, or to bring up, as occaſion ſhall require. Now, for as much, that it hath been the practiſe here in <hi>England,</hi> and in moſt Countries alſo beſides, as I have been infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by very able knowing Souldiers; that the firſt place of Honour that is appointed out unto the <hi>Captaines,</hi> is firſt unto the eldeſt; who alwayes leads the <hi>Collonels Colours,</hi> or firſt grand Diviſion of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which is the greateſt Honour that can be appointed out unto the <hi>Captaines,</hi> and therefore moſt propereſt and due to him as being Eldeſt. If ſo, as that it is then generally granted, that the leading of the <hi>Collonels Colours,</hi> or the firſt Body, or <hi>Stand</hi> of <hi>Pikes</hi> in the <hi>Collonels</hi> Grand Diviſion, is the firſt and chiefeſt place of Honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Captains;</hi> Why then, certainly, I muſt conclude the ſecond <hi>Captain,</hi> which carries the Number (5) would be infinitely wronged, and injured, if he were denied, and not brought into the left halfe <hi>Ranks,</hi> for there he aptly ſtands to fall in, to lead the <hi>Leiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Collonels Colours,</hi> or the ſecond Body, or <hi>Stand</hi> of Pikes, which is the ſecond place of Honour. Now having reſolved, that it is cleerly the due, and Right for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Captains</hi> place, to lead the ſecond Body of <hi>Pikes;</hi> we muſt then of neceſſity, bring in the youngeſt <hi>Captain</hi> into the left halfe <hi>Ranks</hi> likewiſe; who carries the Number (8) and that will make up an equall proportion, as before expreſt to the third and fourth <hi>Captains;</hi> carrying with them the figures (6 and 7) which are drawn up in the right halfe <hi>Rank.</hi>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore further pray obſerve with me this again in examining of the ſutableneſſe, and equall proportion of Worth, and number of the firſt and fourth Worth, carrying unto that of the ſecond and third. And thus far you may reſt, and ſatisfie your ſelfe therein. We have therefore now no more to place, and ſettle, but the fifth, and ſixth Worth, and then our work in this Table will be quickly finiſhed. Therefore of neceſſity, as formerly expreſſed, we muſt bring in the fifth Worth, into the left halfe <hi>Ranks,</hi> as being the ſecond <hi>Captaine;</hi> whoſe proper place as I ſaid before, is to lead the <hi>Lieutenant Collonels</hi> Colours, or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Body, or <hi>Stand</hi> of <hi>Pikes.</hi> He being there thus fixed, we have no more to place, but the ſixth Worth, which is the laſt, or youngeſt <hi>Captain;</hi> and we have no other place to bring him in, but between the firſt and fourth Worth, or if you will have it more cleere, between the <hi>Collonel,</hi> and eldeſt <hi>Captain.</hi> But, here by the way, I am like to meet with ſome Objector, that will ſay, Sir, What's become of your equall proportion here? Your right halfe <hi>Ranks,</hi> with your left, as you have ſo formerly ſtated them; your right halfe <hi>Ranks</hi> carrieth, or exceedeth one more in number then your left halfe <hi>Ranks</hi> doth; and where we finde the greater number, we muſt conclude the leſſer dignity, and if ſo, Why do you not rather contrive it on the left, then upon the right? To which I anſwer firſt, that in raiſing up of Companies into a <hi>Regiment,</hi> thoſe that are the <hi>Field</hi> Officers by right ſhould have the moſt men, and greater Companies, then the private <hi>Captains</hi> have; therefore if you will obſerve in the ſtating of this Dignity of a <hi>Rank</hi> ſix a Breſt, you will finde in the left halfe <hi>Ranke,</hi> two <hi>Field</hi> Officers, whoſe Companies are the greater then any private <hi>Captains;</hi> certainly, they muſt needs countervaile with any number of men with the right halfe <hi>Ranks,</hi> for although the <hi>Collonels</hi> Company is, or ought ever to be the greateſt, yet there is no more <hi>Field</hi> Officers, but himſelfe in his Diviſion. And again, ſecondly, where there cannot be an equall dividing of number, (as here you will finde it of ſix a Breſt, or ſix deep) but that there will fall out ſome odd, either on the right halfe <hi>Ranks,</hi> or on the left, and likewiſe the ſame either in the Front half <hi>Files,</hi> or Rear-half<hi>-Files,</hi> as by example in the triall you will eaſily finde, by caſting up the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as they ſtand a Breſt, and they will fall out to be (21:) divide this number into two parts, and you cannot but muſt caſt the odd either on the right, or on the left. Therefore, to conclude, ſince that there is a great poſſibility that there will be an equality of number of men in the left half <hi>Ranks,</hi> ſutable to that of the right, where there ſhall fall out an odd number, that you cannot caſt it into the left half <hi>Ranks,</hi> but that you muſt remove the fifth Worth; in this extremity I ſay you may not do it, but rather place it on the right. For the <hi>Major</hi> having no certain place to march in a Regiment, it is the proper place of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Captain to walke along with the <hi>Lieutenant Collonel,</hi> taking his due place of honour in his diviſion, as the firſt ſhall do by marching with his <hi>Collonel;</hi> and thus much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken of the laſt Table.</p>

                  <p>Thus much, I conceive, may give a right underſtanding to any coming on Souldier, of the true and right ſtating of a <hi>Rank</hi> twelve abreſt, being a thing very needfull for to know, in reſpect that there are many <hi>Regiments</hi> which doe conſiſt of twelve Companies; and when in courſe; as in the ſequell of this Book, when as I ſhall ſhew the manner of drawing up of twelve Companies; there will a little more light appear unto them to their farther knowledge of the ſame. But thus much for the preſent, as concerning a <hi>Rank</hi> twelve a breſt; and now I ſhall come to ſpeak or to touch a little of a <hi>Rank</hi> ten a breſt, and a <hi>File</hi> ten deep.</p>

                  <p>WHat hath been formerly declared concerning a <hi>Rank</hi> twelve a breſt as before ſhewed by every particular place of honour, as they ſtand with the reaſons for the ſame, it may give a cleer underſtanding by the ſame rule to finde the Dignity of places ten a breſt.

                  <p>But for as much that in this <hi>Range</hi> of ten a breſt there will fall out ſome odd, we muſt then of neceſſity ſake, place it upon the right, and not on the left, for the reaſons as formerly for a <hi>File</hi> ſix deep declared.

But as concerning the opening of <hi>Ranks,</hi> the propereſt way in my judgement is to open them always to the Reer, in reſpect it is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with more facility: For every <hi>Rank</hi> from the firſt takes his due <hi>Diſtance,</hi> as he is commanded, without any further trouble, or to a halfe facing to the right, by taking it from the Reer, if from that place they ſhall be opened; and ſo likewiſe it were a great deal better in the cloſing of <hi>Ranks,</hi> to cloſe them forwards, in reſpect it is for the more coveniency of their cloſing, then to the Reer. For then, again, they muſt perform a half <hi>facing,</hi> which is not only handſome, but troubleſome to the Souldier. All that can be ſaid for to maintain it, (as, I conceive, in opening <hi>Ranks,</hi> forwards) is becauſe they have not room in the <hi>Reer,</hi> which ſeldome happens ſo in any Exerciſe, if diſcreetly ordered by him that leads them. As for cloſing of the <hi>Ranks</hi> backwards, I cannot conceive any ſolid reaſons to confirme the ſame, and therefore will paſſe over it, and come to cloſe our <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files,</hi> to ſuch <hi>Diſtance,</hi> from whence they firſt were opened.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXI. <hi>The uſe of each perticuler</hi> Diſtance, <hi>and at what time to be uſed.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHerefore, firſt note, that your <hi>Diſtance</hi> of cloſeſt Order, is of chiefeſt uſe unto the <hi>Pike,</hi> in theſe perticulers; as firſt, charging againſt the Horſe, for that the <hi>Ranks</hi> then clapping in their left legs, behind their Leaders right, locking themſelves ſo firme and ſtedfaſt, one within another, which 'twere impoſſible for any Body of Horſe to enter in amongſt them. Secondly, it is of excellent uſe for to maintain a <hi>breach,</hi> and to keep out an Enemy. Thirdly, it is very uſefull to both arms at ſuch time, when a Commander hath any thing of conſequence to diſcover unto his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which he may have many occaſions ſo to do; as before his Exerciſe, to adviſe them to ſilence, to obſerve their words of command, and their directions; and when they are to fight againſt an Enemy, to perſwade, and keep them off from fear, by aſſuring them good reaſons of hopes of overcoming. Theſe, or ſuch like ſpeeches, manytimes a <hi>Captain</hi> may have juſt occaſion to expreſſe himſelfe unto his Company, and being at ſo cloſe a <hi>Diſtance,</hi> they may more aptly hear his words, and obey his Comands. But here now, by the way, too much preaching upon the head of a Company concerning matters of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, is too much a dulling of the Souldier, who rather would fall into action, then ſo to be confounded with much talking.</p>
                  <p>Cloſe order may be of very good uſe alſo, for moſt things which hath been ſpoken of the cloſeſt order; only here the Souldier hath a little more liberty in the handling of his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40901:20"/> arms, by being at a wider <hi>Diſtance.</hi> This <hi>Diſtance</hi> alſo is of good uſe, before <hi>wheelings,</hi> becauſe many times upon their moving, they are apt to flie out to their proper <hi>Diſtance</hi> of order, which they always ſhould be at in their <hi>wheelings,</hi> where note, if firſt they were at order, they would flie out to wider <hi>Diſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Order is the <hi>Diſtance</hi> which the Souldier doth fight upon, and is to be uſed skirmiſhing againſt an Enemy; it is alſo uſefull at ſuch time, when the <hi>Drum</hi> ſhall beat a <hi>Troop,</hi> and that the Souldiers are marching to relieve ſome Court of <hi>Guard,</hi> or making ſome expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt an Enemy, for then they are in a fit capacity of <hi>Diſtance,</hi> for to fight. It is alſo very uſefull, and to be obſerved upon <hi>facings,</hi> for all <hi>intire doublings,</hi> and for <hi>wheelings;</hi> Order likewiſe in <hi>File,</hi> and open order in <hi>Rank,</hi> is to be uſed at ſuch time when the <hi>Drum,</hi> ſhall beat a march, and the Body upon their moving, or marching.</p>
                  <p>Open order is the <hi>Diſtance</hi> proper for all <hi>doublings</hi> of <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files,</hi> by the half<hi>-Files</hi> or by the <hi>Bringers up,</hi> wherein they have <hi>intervall</hi> of ground, ſufficient to move in. It is alſo a very proper <hi>Diſtance</hi> for <hi>facings,</hi> and ever to be obſerved in time of <hi>Counter-marches</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the propereſt diſtance for the Ranks to be in upon a <hi>March,</hi> but the <hi>Files</hi> are then, to be at order, as is before expreſt.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of <hi>double Diſtance</hi> is to be obſerved at ſuch times when the Souldiers ſhall ſtand, or happen to be in ſome eminent danger of the <hi>Cannon</hi> ſhot, from the Enemy; for ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then ſo <hi>thinne,</hi> they may be much preſerved from danger; it is likewiſe very good for <hi>Inverſion,</hi> and <hi>Converſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may take notice of theſe briefe directions, in openings of <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files,</hi> when the <hi>Files</hi> are commanded to open to the right, the left hand <hi>File</hi> ſtands, and all the <hi>Files</hi> take their <hi>Diſtance</hi> from the left, obſerving always in the Motions of <hi>Files,</hi> their <hi>Leaders,</hi> and to move altogether along with them. If it be an opening of <hi>Files</hi> to the left, then contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wayes, the right hand <hi>File</hi> ſtands, and they take their <hi>Diſtance</hi> from the right. So likewiſe for cloſings unto what hand ſoever they be commanded to cloſe, the out-moſt <hi>File</hi> is to ſtand, the reſt are to move and cloſe to that. In opening or cloſing of <hi>Ranks,</hi> the firſt <hi>Rank</hi> is always to ſtand, the reſt are to move either opening or cloſing, according as is commanded, always obſerving in their motions their right-hand-men, and moving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Poſtures</hi> being formerly deſcribed forth, the diginity of places in a <hi>File,</hi> and words of Command made known unto the Souldier for their ſeverall <hi>Diſtances.</hi> It next followeth to ſhew the joyning of <hi>Files,</hi> and drawing up a Company; where firſt pray minde at ſuch times when the <hi>Drums</hi> are beating about the <hi>Quarters,</hi> and in ſeverall places makes <hi>Proclamation,</hi> (as by order from their <hi>Captain,)</hi> for all Gentlemen Souldiers that are under his Command, to repair unto his <hi>Randezvous,</hi> unto ſuch a place, and at ſuch an hour; then it muſt be the immediate care of every Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer under his Command, punctually at that hour and place, thither to repair, for the more incouraging of the Souldiers as they ſhall come in, and not to ſtir themſelves from thence, without ſome order from their <hi>Captain,</hi> for fear of giving bad examples unto others. And when they ſhall perceive ſome conſiderable number of men to come in, the <hi>Serjeants</hi> then may take advice with their <hi>Lieutenant</hi> and <hi>Enſigne,</hi> which of them they will appoint out to draw forth the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and which the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and whom they ſhall make the right hand <hi>File-leader</hi> of the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and who ſhall be the left; and again, who ſhall be the Leader of the right hand <hi>File</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> and who ſhall be the left. For theſe four, being ſuch remarkable places of Honour unto the knowing Souldier, that ſpeciall care muſt be had in placing deſerving men, to be there. Now it is, or ought to be the diſcretion of every <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> and <hi>Enſigne,</hi> (as being Commiſſion-Officers) to reſolve the <hi>Serjeants</hi> herein, that they may with more alacrity go on to draw the reſt up between; and ſo to order unto each of them their perticuler duties, as to carry equall paines in drawing forth the <hi>Files.</hi> Therefore in reſpect, that for the moſt part in every Company, they have three <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants,</hi> two of them ought to take charge in drawing forth the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> (being help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40901:21"/> aſſiſted in Counſell by their <hi>Enſigne:</hi> for at ſuch times the Officers ought not to be idle and to ſtand gazing upon each other, but every one according to his particular place and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould be very active and aſſiſting to each other. In the drawing up the Company, the propereſt way will be then, as you may underſtand, in perfecting up a Company, to draw them forth into <hi>Files,</hi> and to make them ſix deep; as being our cuſtome here in <hi>England,</hi> and farther to have care in chooſing able Souldiers to be <hi>File-leaders,</hi> who having ſpent ſome time and pains in their <hi>Files</hi> in ſhewing them their <hi>Poſtures,</hi> they may be called to joyne into a Body.</p>
                  <p>For farther direction herein unto the <hi>Serjeants</hi> (whoſe proper place it doth belong unto) to obſerve this order in drawing up their <hi>Files,</hi> that they may ingroſſe the <hi>Pikes</hi> into one Body by themſelves and the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> into another, and not to flank the <hi>Pikes</hi> untill ſuch time they ſhall perceive that in both Arms they are compleat. There are likewiſe ſeverall places of honour that the <hi>Serjeants</hi> ought to take notice of, and to be informed of placing of man of worth and deſert in both Armes, that is to ſay, in the Body of <hi>Pikes,</hi> and of the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> which underneath by figures I ſhall ſet forth for farther ſatisfaction therein.</p>
                  <figure>
                     <figDesc>military diagram</figDesc>
                  </figure>
                  <p>Here I have ſet down the manner how the <hi>Serjeants</hi> ſhould draw up their <hi>Files</hi> in each armes a part by themſelves, and have figured forth unto them the foure chiefe places of honour in both arms. It concerns them therefore very much to minde and have regard to theſe particular places, and to order ſuch men of worth there, which may be well deſerving of the ſame, and thoſe Gentlemen whom they ſhall thinke fit after to be worthy of <hi>File-leaders</hi> places, they are to draw them up between the figure (1) and the figure (4,) and between the figure (3) and the figure (2) and that rule to obſerve in both armes, and to be carefull to place good Souldiers in the <hi>Reere,</hi> and ſuch who may be able Souldiers for <hi>Halfe-file-leaders,</hi> becauſe there may be much occaſion by doublings to bring them up for to aſſiſt the <hi>Front.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much, I do confeſſe, may be ſufficient forthe preſent to give directions to the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants</hi> for drawing up the <hi>Files</hi> and joyning them together. Next after I have ſhewn how to flank their <hi>Pikes</hi> with <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> I will ſet forth unto them and the <hi>Drums,</hi> where their places are upon a <hi>ſtand,</hi> and where to be upon a <hi>march.</hi>

                  <p>If it ſhould happen as ſomtimes it doth, for a Company to be very large, as in a <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,</hi> why then they may have juſt cauſe to have foure <hi>Serjeants</hi> as I have thus placed them.

                  <p>Having thus ſtated to them all their proper places, next it will be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the <hi>Captain</hi> to command them to ſhoulder their Arms, both <hi>Pikes</hi> and <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and the Officers and <hi>Drums</hi> taking all their places as before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, they may begin to move and draw forth into a long March as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

                  <p>WHen a Body is drawn up in manner as before expreſſed; the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> being Commander in chiefe, his diſcretion is to ballance the Officers as neer as he can with equall dignity and worth, his <hi>Front</hi> proportionally with the <hi>Reer.</hi> To which purpoſe he takes unto himſelfe the youngeſt <hi>Serjeant,</hi> and places him on the right <hi>Angle</hi> in the <hi>Front,</hi> whereby he may be there ready to march down into the Body or elſwhere, according unto the diſcretion of the <hi>Captain</hi> to fulfill his commands, as alſo to ſtand there as a Spectator of the <hi>Captains</hi> actions, and an aſſiſtant which may be much improvement to him. And in like manner he commands the third <hi>Serjeant</hi> to the left <hi>Angle</hi> in the <hi>Reer;</hi> as being the ſecond youngeſt, and may be a help unto his <hi>Lieutenant</hi> there, as the fourth is to him in the <hi>Front.</hi> The eldeſt <hi>Serjeant,</hi> he orders to the left <hi>Angle,</hi> in the Front, as being the moſt honourable place for him, being there ready to lead upon a march the <hi>Van</hi> of the <hi>Reer-Guard;</hi> &amp; the ſecond <hi>Serjeant</hi> he is appointed to ſtand on the right <hi>Angle</hi> of the <hi>Reer,</hi> to make them equall in dignity unto the Front. Now if you pleaſe to examine the dignity of the <hi>Serjeants,</hi> in the firſt place, as the firſt <hi>Serjeant,</hi> and the fourth, making the number (5) and after take a view of the ſecond place, or <hi>Reer,</hi> and there you ſhall obſerve that the ſecond <hi>Serjeant,</hi> and third, may every way ballance themſelves, to be equivalent in the worth, with the firſt, and fourth, carrying with them a like the ſame number. So that it is cleerly evident, that the <hi>Serjeants</hi> are rightly ſtated in number, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the <hi>Front</hi> proportionably with the <hi>Reer,</hi> in the judgement of any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souldier. Something more may be ſpoken of the ſecond <hi>Serjeants</hi> place, which you may take notice in his <hi>March,</hi> to lead the ſecond Diviſion of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which is the moſt honourableſt place of leading, that is appointed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40901:22"/> forth unto the <hi>Serjeants,</hi> the firſt only excepted, and upon a <hi>Stand,</hi> when they ſhall lead up their Diviſions, every <hi>Serjeant</hi> is to be take him unto his place, as they were at firſt placed, and to continue there untill ſuch time they ſhall receive further order from their <hi>Captain.</hi> Thus much, I conceive, may give ſatisfaction unto the diſcreet Souldier, in theſe perticulers, leaving them liberty to judge according unto their own beſt thoughts, while we endeavour to draw up our <hi>Diviſions</hi> all a Breſt again, and to make ſome deſcription of a Body.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Captain</hi> upon his March having attained ſome convenient place to draw up his Company, makes <hi>Alt,</hi> and commands the <hi>Serjeants</hi> to lead up their <hi>Diviſions,</hi> upon the left, and cauſes the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to open from the <hi>Pikes,</hi> making ſufficient <hi>intervalls</hi> for the <hi>Drums,</hi> to beat two a Breſt, even with the <hi>Front,</hi> the firſt two between the right hand File leader of <hi>Pikes,</hi> and the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> upon the right, the ſecond two <hi>Drums</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like, upon the left. And always the <hi>Captain</hi> ought to march his Company after this manner all a Breſt, provide he have ground ſufficient for the ſame. And being far more gracefull ſo to do, then to march them ſtragling upon a long March, for it doth repreſent in ſome kinde the manner of marching of a <hi>Regiment,</hi> and at ſuch times the <hi>Serjeants</hi> are to march upon the <hi>Angles</hi> as is before deſcribed, moving to and again, ſometimes upon the <hi>Flanks,</hi> and cauſing the Souldiers to keep their Diſtance of order in <hi>File,</hi> and open order in <hi>Rank,</hi> and to march all even a Breſt, and after to return again unto their places.</p>

To which, I anſwer, in the firſt place, the youngeſt <hi>Serjeant</hi> is always to attend the <hi>Captain,</hi> and having no <hi>Diviſion</hi> to lead, he is to be upon the right <hi>Angle</hi> of the <hi>Front,</hi> there expecting his <hi>Captains</hi> pleaſure and comands; and the ſecond <hi>Serjeant</hi> is to lead the ſecond <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> and the eldeſt <hi>Serjeant</hi> to lead the laſt <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> or the <hi>Reer Guard,</hi> here are their places upon the long March.</p>
                  <p>But when they are drawn up, and ſo march even a Breſt, the youngeſt <hi>Serjeants</hi> place, as is before expreſt, is to march upon the right <hi>Angle</hi> in the <hi>Front,</hi> and the eldeſt upon the left, the ſecond <hi>Serjeant</hi> is to march in the right <hi>Angle</hi> in the Reer. They having their places thus ſtated, are to move ſometimes up and down upon the <hi>Flanks,</hi> in their marching, cauſing the Souldiers to keep their due diſtance of order in <hi>File,</hi> and open order in <hi>Rank,</hi> and to march even a Breſt, and after they may return unto their places again.</p>
                  <p>But here, me thinks, I meet with ſome Objector by the way, who ſaith, the eldeſt is much wronged herein; for that it is his proper place to be upon the right; that when <hi>Forlorns</hi> are drawn off againſt an Enemy, he is there ready firſt to lead them on, claiming it as his due, to give the firſt on-ſet, and therefore far more honour for him to be on the right, then on the left, and the youngeſt <hi>Serjeant,</hi> rather to be placed on the left, then on the right; as for the ſecond <hi>Serjeants</hi> place, 'tis fit he ſhould be in the Reer, to aſſiſt the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> there, he having none but he, to help him, if any occaſion ſhould require. To which, I anſwer, that it is the youngeſt <hi>Serjeants</hi> place to be upon the right <hi>Angle,</hi> either upon a <hi>Stand,</hi> or upon a <hi>March,</hi> and not the eldeſt; for theſe reaſons following. The youngeſt <hi>Serjeant</hi> is not placed there for any honour that it is to him, for he hath no <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi> at all to lead upon the <hi>March,</hi> (except the Company be very great) and if ſo, he is placed ſo neer the <hi>Captain,</hi> to be ſerviceable to him to carry, and convey his pleaſures unto all the reſt of the Officers. As for the leading of the <hi>Van-guard,</hi> upon the <hi>March,</hi> the <hi>Captain</hi> takes that place unto himſelfe; and it is far more honour unto the eldeſt <hi>Serjeant</hi> to be a Leader of the <hi>Reer-Guard,</hi> or entirely the left<hi>-Flank,</hi> then to lead a <hi>Sub-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi> of <hi>Pikes.</hi> And beſides that, it is propereſt for his place to be upon the left, when
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40901:22"/> they are all drawn up upon a Breſt, for theſe two reaſons; as firſt, he is there upon in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to take his due place, upon the ſub-dividing on the long March; and again; upon a <hi>Stand,</hi> when they are all drawn up, and ready to ingage againſt an Enemy, and the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorns</hi> to be drawn forth, equally a like from both <hi>Flanks,</hi> he is then as ready in the Front to execute his <hi>Captains</hi> Commands, the youngeſt <hi>Serjeant,</hi> being likewiſe ſent to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing helpfull to him, and attending after for further order from his <hi>Captain,</hi> to ſend him reliefe by the ſecond <hi>Serjeant,</hi> as occaſion ſhall require. So that in my judgement, take it either upon the long March, or others, when drawn all up even a Breſt, all things are ſo ſtated, for his due honour and place, that he hath no reaſon to complain, nor any of the reſt, having all their due, and proper places, which doth belong unto them.</p>
                  <p>As for the placing of the <hi>Drums,</hi> upon the long arch, Mevery Diviſion ought to have his <hi>Drum</hi> to fall between ſuch Ranks, as before expreſt; excepting only the ſecond Diviſion of Pikes, which may be excuſed, when they are to beat a March, as being all drawn up, they are to fall in two, to beat even a Breſt, upon the right, and one, upon the left, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet down. If it ſhould chance further in a Company, to be ſo ſmall to have but three <hi>Diviſions,</hi> that is to ſay, one <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> in the <hi>Van,</hi> the Body of <hi>Pikes</hi> in the midſt, and another <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> to bring up the <hi>Reer-Guard,</hi> and having but two <hi>Serjeants,</hi> and two <hi>Drums;</hi> the youngeſt <hi>Serjeants</hi> place, will be as before mentioned, upon the right in the Front, and the eldeſt <hi>Serjeant</hi> upon the left, and to take his place to lead the laſt <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> upon the long March; and the firſt <hi>Drum</hi> to beat in the firſt <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and the ſecond to beat, and to march along amongſt the <hi>Pikes.</hi> I have a little more enlarged my ſelfe in this diſcourſe of placing of the <hi>Serjeants,</hi> then I at firſt intended; but meeting many times with ſeverall Souldiers, deſiring ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in every one of theſe perticulers, I ſhall perhaps undergo here the hard cenſure of ſome, for this my tedious diſcourſe; but to ſuch others which deſires to be knowing herein, I hope will have a more favourable opinion of my good meaning unto them. And here I ſhall conclude for the preſent, concerning the perticuler places of the <hi>Serjeants,</hi> in every private Companie; and now ſuppoſing, as by order from the <hi>Captain,</hi> the <hi>Serjeants</hi> have brought up their Diviſions, ſtanding again, as before, expecting ſomething more to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto them, they ſilently ſtand to here what follows.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXIV. <hi>A Deſcription of a Body of men through out, with all their ſeverall parts, and kinds.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is a very neceſſary knowledge to every perticuler Souldier, to be acquainted through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with all the parts of a Body of men, drawn up, with their ſeverall extents, and bounds, and with the true underſtanding of the ſame. Where firſt note the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Files,</hi> a <hi>File</hi> is a <hi>Sequence</hi> of men, conſiſting of <hi>Leaders,</hi> and <hi>Followers,</hi> from the firſt, unto the laſt; the joyning of <hi>Files Flank-wiſe,</hi> maketh <hi>Ranks,</hi> and is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating up of a Body: for one <hi>File</hi> alone cannot be ſaid to have any <hi>Ranks</hi> in it, but joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two, or more <hi>Files</hi> together unto one, you may account them (provided they be ſix deep) to have ſo many <hi>Ranks</hi> for number, as doth extend from their <hi>Leaders</hi> to their <hi>Bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers up.</hi> And further know, that a <hi>Rank</hi> is a Row of men, ſtanding ſhoulder to ſhoulder, in an even line from the <hi>left Flank</hi> to the <hi>right;</hi> or from the out-moſt man upon the left, unto the out-moſt man upon the right; ſtanding all in a row File wiſe. Neither can it be ſaid of one <hi>Rank,</hi> to have any <hi>Files</hi> in it; for as the cloſing of <hi>Files</hi> to <hi>Files,</hi> makes <hi>Ranks,</hi> ſo the adding of <hi>Ranks</hi> to <hi>Ranks,</hi> makes <hi>Files.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Depth of <hi>Files,</hi> they have in theſe latter Ages, much varied therein; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times making them ſixteen deep, others ten, and eight deep, and now lately, they have brought them unto ſix deep, as being the cuſtome of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together now the practiſe here in <hi>England.</hi> In which form and way, I purpoſe to walk, but to proceed to my former promiſe to the Souldier: There is in every Body of men, drawn up, conſiſting of <hi>Pikes,</hi> and <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> whether of greater or ſmaller number, it makes no matter; a <hi>Front,</hi> a <hi>Reer,</hi> a <hi>Right-Flank,</hi> and a <hi>Left-Flank;</hi> there is alſo <hi>Front half-Files,</hi> and <hi>Reer half-Files;</hi> there is a <hi>Right half-Ranks,</hi> and a <hi>Left half-Ranks;</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40901:23"/> there is a <hi>Length,</hi> and <hi>Depth</hi> of the Battail: and of every one of theſe in their ſeverall kinds, they have their perticuler extents, and bounds, according to their number of men.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, take notice in the firſt place, that the <hi>Front</hi> is the firſt <hi>Rank,</hi> or row of men, which are the <hi>File-leaders,</hi> and chief men of their <hi>Files,</hi> who properly ought to take charge of their <hi>Files,</hi> being as it were their <hi>Captains,</hi> and leads them firſt on in the Brunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a furious Enemy; the extent of the <hi>Front</hi> is from the left hand <hi>File-Leader,</hi> unto the <hi>Leader</hi> of the right hand <hi>File.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Reer</hi> is the laſt Row or <hi>Rank</hi> of men, being the <hi>Bringers-up</hi> of the <hi>Files,</hi> who next the <hi>Leaders</hi> are the chiefeſt men of honour in the <hi>File,</hi> and are as it were unto them, their <hi>Lieutenants,</hi> and in the abſence of the <hi>Leaders,</hi> they are to take charge of the <hi>File,</hi> and to inſtruct them in their <hi>Poſtures:</hi> the extent of the <hi>Reer,</hi> is from the <hi>Bringer-up</hi> of the left hand <hi>File,</hi> unto the place of the <hi>Bringer-up</hi> of the right.</p>
                  <p>The right <hi>Flank</hi> is the out-moſt <hi>File,</hi> upon the right, where always ought, by the way, to be very able Souldiers placed, becauſe they firſt give on-ſet, or fire againſt the Enemy, if on that part they ſhall be charged; the extent of the right <hi>Flank</hi> is from the <hi>Leader</hi> of the right hand <hi>File,</hi> unto the <hi>Bringer-up</hi> of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The left <hi>Flank,</hi> likewiſe is the out-moſt <hi>File</hi> upon the left, and his extent is from the <hi>Leader</hi> of the left hand <hi>File,</hi> unto the <hi>Bringer-up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Front half-Files</hi> extent or bounds, reacheth no further then from the <hi>Front,</hi> unto the midſt of <hi>Ranks,</hi> or to the <hi>Bringers-up</hi> of the <hi>Front half-Files,</hi> which being but ſix deep, is the third <hi>Rank</hi> from the <hi>Front,</hi> and the <hi>Length</hi> of the ſame reacheth from the out-moſt part of the left <hi>Flank,</hi> untill you come unto the right.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Reer half-Files</hi> beginneth from the midſt of <hi>Ranks,</hi> or from the fourth <hi>Rank</hi> from the <hi>Front,</hi> and runneth downward in his <hi>depth</hi> to the <hi>Bringer-up</hi> of the whole <hi>File,</hi> and the <hi>Length</hi> of the ſame is to be taken ſide-wiſe, as they ſtand ſhoulder to ſhoulder, from the out-moſt man upon the left, unto the out-moſt man upon the right.</p>
                  <p>The right half <hi>Ranks,</hi> in their <hi>Length,</hi> runneth no further, then from the out-moſt man upon the right, unto the midſt of <hi>Files,</hi> or to the left hand <hi>File-leader</hi> of the right <hi>half-Ranks;</hi> the <hi>Depth</hi> of the right <hi>half-Ranks</hi> reacheth from the Front, running down unto to the <hi>Reer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the left <hi>half-Ranks,</hi> as much may be ſaid, to take his <hi>Length,</hi> from the midſt of <hi>Files,</hi> or from the right hand <hi>File-leader,</hi> of the left <hi>half-Ranks</hi> unto the out-moſt <hi>Files</hi> upon the left; the <hi>Depth</hi> of the left <hi>half-Ranks,</hi> may be underſtood in form and manner, conformable to the right.</p>
                  <p>Next come we to ſpeak of the <hi>Length</hi> and <hi>Depth</hi> of the whole Battail; the <hi>Length</hi> of the Battail is ever to be accounted of the number of men in a <hi>Rank,</hi> and not in a <hi>File;</hi> for the <hi>Files</hi> perhaps may not be above ſix deep, when that there may be hundreds in a Breſt in the <hi>Ranks,</hi> and farther the <hi>Length</hi> of any Battail is to be taken from the out-moſt point of the <hi>left-Flank,</hi> or left-hand <hi>File-leader,</hi> ſtretching it ſelfe forth by an even <hi>Line</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, untill you come to the outmoſt point of right <hi>Flank,</hi> or right-hand <hi>File-leader;</hi> the <hi>Depth</hi> of the Battail always is to be taken from the <hi>Front,</hi> or firſt <hi>Rank,</hi> and going down backward in a ſtraight <hi>Line</hi> down to the <hi>Reer,</hi> to the laſt <hi>Rank,</hi> or to the <hi>Bringers-up</hi> of the <hi>Files.</hi> For as the <hi>Length</hi> of the Battail is to be taken from the left <hi>Flank,</hi> going a long in <hi>Front</hi> unto the right, ſo the <hi>Depth</hi> of the Battail is to be taken from the <hi>Front,</hi> going backward down to the <hi>Reer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is alſo to be underſtood that in every <hi>Battalia</hi> drawn up, there are other parts and Denominations, very conſiderable to be known; that is, in every ſuch an one, there is a <hi>Van-Guard,</hi> a <hi>Reer-Ward,</hi> and <hi>Main-Battail.</hi> The <hi>Van-guard</hi> are the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> upon the right, or the right <hi>Flank;</hi> or as moſt commonly called amongſt us in theſe dayes, the <hi>Right-wing,</hi> or the <hi>Left-wing,</hi> which are the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and the Flankers of the Body of <hi>Pikes,</hi> the reaſon, as I conceive, the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> are accounted and called <hi>Wings,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are firſt drawn off, as by <hi>flying</hi> motion in <hi>Forlorns,</hi> to ingage againſt an Enemy; but of this by the way, to proceed: the <hi>Reer-Ward,</hi> or <hi>Reer-Guard,</hi> are the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> on the left <hi>Flank;</hi> and the Battail is the Body of <hi>Pikes,</hi> and here I ſhall conclude concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Deſcription of a Body.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXVI. <hi>Directions to all ſuch as ſhall deſire to exerciſe a Foot-Company, with ſome admonitions to the Souldiers, as ſhall be exerciſed by them.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HE that intends to exerciſe a Body of men, muſt truly know what he ſhall command, and ſo to give his directions unto the Souldiers, as they may aptly make ready ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the ſame. He muſt at ſuch times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> above all the reſt, aſſume unto himſelf the confidence &amp; preſence (as near as he is able) of a compleat Souldier. He is alſo to <hi>ſtretch</hi> out his voice ſo, as he may conveniently be heard, &amp; underſtood by the inferiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Souldiers; which will cauſe them more readily to obey his Commands. He ought to carry a cheerfull countenance unto them, provided they do well; but otherwiſe, if care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly diſ-regarding his Commands, he may look harſhly upon them. His eyes ought to be quick and nimble, obſerving all their Motions, whether it be to the right, or left, to the <hi>Front,</hi> or <hi>Reer;</hi> and nimbly ſtepping to them, to ſtay them, if diſorderly they ſwerve awry from what he firſt intended. He muſt likewiſe order all his Words of Command ſo, as that they may be proper, and cleerly pronounced forth unto the Souldier, without any faltering. And in every one of theſe, to ſee the Souldier leaſurely and eaſily perform the ſame in a compleat manner. He muſt not be two quick in his Words of Command, but carefully ſee what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded, well done, and then he may proceed unto the next. In time of his Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, he muſt ſeriouſly mind what he is to do, and not to have his thoughts extravigantly carried away upon any other Subject, for fear he be out, but if any ſuch thing ſhould happen through forgetfulneſſe, he ought not to be daunted, but to pull up the Spirit of a Souldier as well as he can, and endeavour to reduce them again. For it is a rare thing to be found, for a <hi>Leader</hi> to be ſo exquiſite in his Exerciſing, as not to be ſomtimes out; and in my obſervation of moſt, at one time or another, I have found them ſo to be. His diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo ought to be ſuch, as to cull out, and chuſe thoſe things that be chiefeſt; as flowers out of a Garden, to fit and compleat up his Exerciſe in a Souldier-like way; which may be moſt propereſt for ſervice and uſe, which will bring to him far more commendations and praiſe in the judgement of every knowing Souldier, then to ſpend his time upon unneceſſary <hi>

                        </gap>oyes;</hi> but yet ſomtimes to pleaſe the fancie of the curious, at their private meetings, he may uſe ſome things for delight, to ſupport and uphold their private Exerciſes; which have nurſt up, here in <hi>London,</hi> many able Souldiers, and Commanders; who have been ſerviceable to our Nation. It is a very neceſſary thing likewiſe that a <hi>Leader</hi> ſomtimes do acquaint the Souldiers of the uſe of their ſeverall <hi>Diſtances, Facings, Doublings, Coun-marches,</hi> and <hi>wheelings,</hi> and of all things elſe he ſhall command; but in ſuch a manner, that he dwell not too long upon any thing, he ſhall declare unto them, for dulling of the, Souldiers, who rather would be pleaſed with more actings, then by too much talkings: which ſpins out the time, as ſomtimes ordered, to very little purpoſe. He muſt be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of every Word of Command he gives, that the Souldiers be ordered in their due <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> ſutable to the ſame, of what kind ſoever it be; and if it ſhall be loſt in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, or marchings; he muſt endeavour to bring them to it again. He is likewiſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Souldiers when they are drawn up, to look about them, and to minde their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places, how they ſtand in the Body, whether they be in even <hi>Ranks</hi> from the <hi>Front,</hi> or <hi>odd;</hi> if even, and upon any doubling of <hi>Ranks,</hi> they are the men to <hi>double</hi> the <hi>odd;</hi> if half <hi>File-leaders,</hi> that they be commanded to <hi>double</hi> the <hi>Front;</hi> they muſt advance their Arms, and are <hi>Leaders</hi> of that Motion to come up to <hi>double</hi> the <hi>Front:</hi> if <hi>Bringers-up</hi> commanded to <hi>double,</hi> they are a like to do the ſame; if <hi>Bringers-up</hi> of the <hi>Front half-Files,</hi> and that they be commanded to <hi>double</hi> the <hi>Reer,</hi> they likewiſe are to advance their Arms; to face about, and are to begin to lead them down to the <hi>Reer.</hi> They ſhould likewiſe take notice, how they ſtand in their <hi>Files,</hi> whether even from the right, or no; if even, and there be any command to <hi>double Files</hi> to the right, they all are to move, and to <hi>double</hi> the <hi>odd;</hi> if commanded to <hi>double</hi> to the left, they then ſtand odd, and the others are to move, and <hi>double</hi> them. They likewiſe are to mind their places, who are upon the <hi>Flanks;</hi> for a <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi> either to <hi>Front,</hi> or <hi>Reer,</hi> by the <hi>half-Files,</hi> they firſt begin to march, and how they ſtand there as right, and left-hand men in even <hi>Ranks;</hi> for by any <hi>doublings</hi> of <hi>Ranks</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, or by <hi>Diviſion,</hi> they likewiſe are the <hi>Leaders</hi> of the Motion. There ought alſo advice be given to the middle <hi>File-leaders,</hi> to know their places; for if there ſhould be any <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings</hi> of the <hi>half-Ranks,</hi> they then are firſt to move, and to begin the Motion.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40901:24"/>
                  <p>This caution being ſomtimes quickly run over in adviſing of the Souldiers, that they ſhould ever minde when they are firſt drawn up into a body theſe particular places, they would not ſtand ſo careleſly and ſo ignorantly in a Body, as many times they doe, not knowing which way to move without a great deale of pains and directions from their <hi>Leader,</hi> for there being ſo many occaſions of <hi>doublings</hi> of theſe kinds, that it is a neceſſary thing for every Souldiers to be acquainted with the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is not only ſufficient that the Souldiers doe minde their places as they ſtand in a body, according to the direction of their <hi>Leader,</hi> as before ſet forth unto them, but that they be likewiſe, in the time of their Exerciſe, very ſilent in the body, and helpfull unto their fellow-Souldiers by pointing out unto them with ſignes with the hand, where they ſhould march, to performe what was before commanded, and to be very civill, and orderly in their carriage to each other, and to minde their Exerciſe ſo as a matter of great weight, and high conſideration in the well regarding of the ſame. And if a word of command (as ſomtimes may happen) ſlip out of order, as by the miſtaking of a hand or the like, yet nevertheleſſe it ſhould be their modeſt care, if not prevented by him, to be ready to execute what they conceive he intended, and walking along in this civill and reſpective way unto him that ſhall lead them, it will not only be a great encouragement unto him, but they will alſo reap much benefit unto themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And thus much briefly may be ſpoken in way of advice unto every <hi>Leader</hi> before his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Exerciſe, and unto each particular Souldier as ſhall by him be exerciſed.</p>

                  <p>

For in the others they alter the forme of the Battail or changeth the place, but in this they preſerve both, and it is ready for any attempt of an enemy if they ſhould be charged all at once in <hi>Front, Reer, Right</hi> and <hi>Left Flanks,</hi> they may be commanded ſo to face as to anſwer them all in every one of their charges.</p>

                     <hi>Facings</hi> likewiſe are ſo neceſſary that they can hardly be ſpared in any other of the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons having relation in one kinde or other to them, all for to be uſed: There is likewiſe farther to be underſtood that there are <hi>entire facings</hi> and <hi>diviſionall. Entire facings</hi> are when they turn their <hi>Aſpects</hi> all one way: <hi>Diviſionall facings</hi> are when they diver or turn their faces ſeverall ways, as to the <hi>Front, Reer,</hi> and both <hi>Flanks,</hi> all at one inſtant of time as ſhall be commanded.</p>
                  <p>There are likewiſe <hi>facings</hi> to the <hi>front</hi> and <hi>reer Angles,</hi> that is to ſay, of their <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward Angles. Outward Angles</hi> are when they are commanded to face to the <hi>right Angle</hi> or to the left, or both <hi>facing</hi> to the <hi>inward Angles,</hi> as when they are commanded ſo, as to face to the <hi>inward Angles</hi> towards the midſt of <hi>files.</hi> There is likewiſe <hi>facing</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40901:24"/> 
                     <hi>Angles</hi> towards the midſt of <hi>Ranks</hi> as to the <hi>Center,</hi> where note, when there is any uſe of theſe <hi>facings</hi> unto the <hi>inward Angles,</hi> it is occaſioned by ſome former words of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that hath made ſome large <hi>intervalls</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Ranks</hi> or <hi>Files,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may give them ſuch commands as theſe for to open or ſtand ſo, that they may march and cloſe again as at firſt.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>facing</hi> to the <hi>Center,</hi> I do conceive, to be very, uſefull, when the <hi>Captain</hi> or <hi>Leader</hi> hath any thing of importance to ſpeake unto the Company; they ſtanding at cloſe order, he may ſidewiſe move down into the midſt of the <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files,</hi> and command them to face all to the <hi>Center;</hi> they ſtanding all round about him ſo cloſe; cannot chooſe but hear and know what his pleaſure and command will be, and in obedience thereunto, be very ready in performance for the execution of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But before I come to ſet down the words of command for <hi>facings,</hi> I ſhall deſire all <hi>Leaders</hi> not to tie themſelves up ſo as not to begin in their Exerciſe to command <hi>facings,</hi> untill they have brought the ſouldiers to ſtand at open order both in <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>File,</hi> as if it were not proper for them to command them to face till then. Therefore rather, for the reaſons before ſet forth, command them to chooſe upon ſuch cloſe <hi>Diſtances</hi> to face, that they may know the true uſe of them, and at ſuch times when they want ground that the other motions cannot be performed.</p>

                     </hi> and of the <hi>half Ranks.</hi> Now there are ſeverall Words of Command for the performance of each of theſe, as to <hi>double Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files,</hi> which do conſiſt either of the <hi>doubling</hi> of number of men, and perſons, and not of place, or elſe the <hi>doubling</hi> both of number, and place; as for example, command either the <hi>Ranks,</hi> the <hi>half-files,</hi> or <hi>Bringers-up</hi> to <hi>double</hi> the <hi>Front</hi> to the right; here only is the <hi>doubling</hi> of number of men, and not of place, for it adds but one man more to that hand, whereunto they were commanded, and gains but his perticuler place. Again, <hi>Double Ranks</hi> to any hand <hi>intire</hi> or <hi>double,</hi> the <hi>Front</hi> by the <hi>half-files</hi> to the right <hi>intire,</hi> it will be not only a <hi>doubling</hi> of the number of men, but a <hi>doubling</hi> of the place, and the <hi>Length</hi> of the Battail. The uſe of <hi>doubling</hi> the <hi>Length</hi> of the Battail may be for two reaſons, the one to over<hi>-wing</hi> an Enemy, the other to avoid over<hi>-winging</hi> our ſelves. Yet there muſt be care taken, that in <hi>doubling</hi> of the <hi>Length,</hi> that we faile not, or be too weak in our <hi>Depth,</hi> for the want of both, either <hi>Length</hi> or <hi>Depth,</hi> may be very dangerous to our ſelves, and may give great advantage to the Enemy. For if there ſhould want a ſufficient <hi>Depth,</hi> by gaining much <hi>Length</hi> in the <hi>Front,</hi> we may perhaps be ſo weak there, that an Enemy may quickly break through, whereby much danger may inſult upon the ſame, if not timely prevented by the diſcretion of the Commanders.</p>
                  <p>There is likewiſe in the <hi>doubling</hi> of <hi>Files,</hi> or the <hi>half-files,</hi> or the <hi>half-Ranks, doubling</hi> to either <hi>Flank,</hi> a <hi>doubling</hi> of number of men, and not of place, carrying much variety of Words of Command; but the <hi>doubling</hi> of <hi>Files,</hi> and of the left <hi>half-Ranks intire,</hi> the <hi>Depth</hi> of the right <hi>Flank,</hi> is not only a <hi>doubling</hi> of the number, but a <hi>doubling</hi> of the place and <hi>depth</hi> of the Battail. In this <hi>doubling</hi> of the <hi>Depth,</hi> care likewiſe muſt be had, that we make not the <hi>

                  <p>And here Fellow-Souldier endeth all the ſeverall kinds of <hi>Doublings,</hi> which if any ſhall ſeem hard or difficult unto thee, either in their Commands, Directions, or Reducements, thou maiſt (care being taken) with much eaſe and delight performe the ſame.

                        </gap>ield-ſervice</hi> have train'd up, and ſent forth many worthy, able &amp; gallant <hi>Souldiers</hi> into the <hi>Armies</hi> lately raiſed in our Nation between the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> whom I pray God happily to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile. But, ſuppoſe, many of theſe <hi>Doublings</hi> have not been ſeen by ſome to be uſed in the field: Are they not therefore uſeful? perhaps at ſuch time they have had no occaſion for to uſe them all, which if not: muſt they be rejected? the anſwer poſitively, that being rightly enquired into, they have in them very uſefull, and ſerviceable things againſt an Enemy whether it be in the <hi>Field</hi> or in <hi>Garriſon.</hi> As for example the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> being brought either all into the <hi>Front</hi> or <hi>Reer</hi> or upon one of the <hi>Flanks</hi> which often hapneth, an Enemy appearing there, then they would be of ſingular good uſe for our advantage, and very diſadvantageous to the enemy. The like may be ſpoken of the <hi>Pikes,</hi> who are by ſeverall of theſe <hi>doublings</hi> brought into thoſe places, being there very ſerviceable to receive a deſperate charge of horſe, if upon any of theſe parts they ſhould fall on. Obſerve, further, that in many of theſe <hi>doublings,</hi> as the one arms ſhall <hi>face</hi> or charge againſt an enemy, ſo contrariwiſe the other lies more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in ſafety to be preſerv'd from danger of the ſhot. Moreover, (according unto the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men either in <hi>length</hi> or <hi>depth)</hi> a <hi>Leader</hi> may by theſe words of Command or the like, at the ſame time <hi>double</hi> his <hi>Front, Reer,</hi> or <hi>Midſt</hi> by <hi>doubling</hi> of <hi>Ranks,</hi> and may farther make uſe of them at one and the ſame time to <hi>double</hi> by <hi>files</hi> his right, left <hi>Flank</hi> and <hi>Midſt</hi> all at one inſtant. But I ſhall not not need to ſet down words of Command for the <hi>doubling Front, Reer, Flanks</hi> and <hi>Midſt,</hi> after this manner, but leave that unto the apt <hi>Souldier</hi> to make uſe of ſuch words of Command formerly ſhewne, and to frame them ſutable for any ſuch purpoſe ſo intended. But before I ſhall conclude concerning the uſe of theſe <hi>doublings,</hi> as I ſaid before, there are many of them, which by comand will bring any men in the body, to fight, unto that part which ſhal be moſt weak, or aſſaulted by an enemy. And, again, he may caſt them, ſo into the body by a <hi>doubling,</hi> as ſhall preſerve from danger, whom he ſhall think fit. And to ſay more there is no part of the body or arms but by words of Command in <hi>doublings</hi> may be brought forth as <hi>Frontiers</hi> againſt the enemy, and may be placed again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the midſt of the body for more ſecurity, and others in like manner may be brought forth for their relief. Therefore it much concerns all <hi>Souldiers</hi> and <hi>Commanders</hi> to be truly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the ſeverall kinds of <hi>doublings,</hi> out of which he may make ſingular good uſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his diſcretion at all ſuch times as need ſhal require, whether it be in <hi>Field,</hi> or otherwiſe in <hi>Garriſon.</hi>

                  <p>NOt to omit any thing which may be beneficiall for the knowledge of all them that intends to be good proficients in this <hi>Art of Military Diſcipline,</hi> my ſubject in this Chapter ſhall be of <hi>Ranks filing,</hi> and <hi>files, filing,</hi> and <hi>ranks, ranking,</hi> and <hi>files ranking,</hi> which are by ſome called <hi>Inverſion,</hi> and <hi>Converſion;</hi> yet ſeldome mentioned by any <hi>Leader</hi> in the time of his <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> for this reaſon, as I ſuppoſe, becauſe the ſouldiers for the moſt part are unacquainted with them; which cauſeth all our <hi>Leaders</hi> in our private <hi>Meetings</hi> here in <hi>London,</hi> to deliver forth unto their <hi>Souldiers</hi> ſuch words of command as may readily and aptly be underſtood by them, which are <hi>ranks, file</hi> to the right or left, or <hi>files, file</hi> to any hand, which is no other then <hi>Inverſion,</hi> and again <hi>ranks, rank</hi> to the right or left, either in equal or unequal parts, or intire to the <hi>front</hi> or <hi>files</hi> to <hi>rank</hi> in the like kinde may be termed <hi>Converſion:</hi> And, in my opinion, they do the better that ſhall thus expreſs themſelves to the capacity of every Souldier, then for to puſle them with the words <hi>Inverſion</hi> and <hi>Converſion.</hi> I intend therefore without curioſity plainly to ſet downe their ſeverall commands, directions, and reducements, keeping my former method, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40901:29"/> doublings. For in all and every one of them, they do either double the <hi>length</hi> or <hi>depth</hi> of the <hi>Front, Reer, Midſt,</hi> or <hi>Flanks;</hi> no part of the <hi>Military Exerciſe</hi> affording more plenty of matter then they, carrying always along with them many things of excellent uſe. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſuppoſe a Prince, Generall, or any other perſon of quality were to paſs thorow the Company, a diſcreet Commander would preſently command their <hi>ranks</hi> to <hi>invert,</hi> or <hi>file</hi> to the right and left inward, which immediatly becomes (as it were a <hi>Street</hi> or <hi>Gallery,</hi> for the honouring and ſecuring of their perſons. Moreover, it is of uſe for the lodging of the <hi>Colours,</hi> or upon <hi>funerall</hi> occaſions, or taking their leave from their <hi>Captain,</hi> where they may poure forth their <hi>volley's</hi> of ſhot all at one and the ſame time. To be ſhort, being neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to march againſt a battery, it avoids the danger of the great <hi>Ordnance,</hi> and likewiſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the <hi>front</hi> of the <hi>Battalia,</hi> from the imminent danger of any great ſhower of ſmall ſhot poured forth by the Enemy. As likewiſe it is of excellent uſe to march over a narrow <hi>Bridge,</hi> or thorow a <hi>Lane, Thicket,</hi> or <hi>Salliport,</hi> or ſuch like difficult paſſages; or if any <hi>Commander</hi> have a deſire to uſe ancient figures, by it he may make the <hi>Saw, Sheers,</hi> or <hi>Diamond;</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one <hi>file,</hi> they may aptly be drawn into a <hi>Ring,</hi> where hee that is an able <hi>poſture</hi> man ſtanding in the midſt, may ſhew unto them their ſeverall <hi>poſtures,</hi> and after eaſily reduce them again, and thus much briefly of <hi>Inverſion,</hi> or <hi>ranks filing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next come we to ſhew the excellent uſes and ſervices which may be performed by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> as firſt perceiving any man of worth to ſtand before the <hi>front</hi> of the <hi>battail,</hi> or to paſs by either of the <hi>flanks,</hi> then <hi>ranks, ranking,</hi> or <hi>files ranking</hi> into the <hi>front,</hi> or <hi>ranks</hi> wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to either of the <hi>flanks,</hi> by theſe commands the ſouldiers aſpects are thither brought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto him a volley of ſhot. It is likewiſe very uſefull for the making of a <hi>Line</hi> againſt a Breſt-work, or lining of <hi>hedges,</hi> carrying it ſelf ſeverall ways ſecretly to lye in <hi>Ambuſcado,</hi> whereby they may fire upon the Enemy as he marcheth by. Or approching againſt any <hi>Fort</hi> or place of danger, they may daringly make a large <hi>front,</hi> and firing upon them, after <hi>filing</hi> to the right or left, making large <hi>intervalls,</hi> they much preſerve themſelves from the danger of the great ſhot proceeding from the Enemy. Again, <hi>ranks ranking</hi> either in equall, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall parts is of ſingular good uſe upon a narrow paſſage, where they can march but 2, 3, 4, or 6 a Breſt; the Commander, notwithſtanding, they marched before 20 a Breſt, may by it bring them to ſuch ſmall numbers, whereby hee may much preſerve them in time of imminent danger and perill. To dwell no longer upon this diſcourſe, <hi>Inverſion</hi> and <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> many times requres larger diſtance then any other of the <hi>Motions,</hi> as ſometimes double diſtance or twice double diſtance, wherefore being ſo many occaſions for the uſe of them both, I hold it requiſite for a <hi>Leader</hi> frequently to practiſe his ſouldiers in them, no part of the <hi>Art Military,</hi> affording more commendations to the <hi>Souldiers</hi> that ſhall readily and handſomly perform the ſame. Briefly, therefore, paſſing over what might be more ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. I ſhall in the next place ſet them all forth in their full view, leaving every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet <hi>Souldier</hi> to his own liberty, to make uſe of as many of them as hee ſhall think fit, and to uſe them after what manner he pleaſeth.</p>

                  <p>Yet before I enter in any other diſcourſe of the <hi>Art Military,</hi> I hold it requiſite to give ſome admonitions to thoſe that ſhall venture upon them. For being very difficult, they are not eaſily underſtood by every punie; my advice therefore, is to wave ſuch things, in time of Exerciſe, which the Souldiers are unacquainted with, providing for them ſuch matter, as is both plain and eaſie, and being frequently practiſed in ſuch, he may after <hi>drill</hi> them on to harder, till by degrees he hath brought them unto ſuch perfection &amp; knowledge, that they ſhall be able to perform and execute what is commanded; not gazing upon one another, (as I have often obſerved) neither knowing their <hi>Leaders</hi> meaning, or if they did, they are altogether ignorant how to fullfill his commands. Frequent practiſe therefore makes the Souldier expert, witneſſe our gallant Souldiers and Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who are moſt of them ſo well grounded (by frequent practiſe) that their <hi>Lenders</hi> can ſcarce give a word of Command which is not eaſily apprehended by them, they being in their Exerciſes ſo often inured to ſuch difficult expreſſions as theſe of <hi>Inverſion</hi> and <hi>Converſion.</hi>

As firſt, to look down in the Body where his <hi>File-leaders</hi> are, and where his <hi>Bringers-up:</hi> and likewiſe making the ſeverall places of his halfe <hi>File-leaders,</hi> and the <hi>Bringers-up</hi> of his <hi>Front half-files,</hi> together with his <hi>Flankers,</hi> and his middle <hi>Files:</hi> this ſpeciall care being taken, he may begin, and proceed to their Reducement, after this manner.</p>
                  <p>If by ſome former Counter-marches, his <hi>File-leaders</hi> are in the place of his halfe <hi>File-leaders,</hi> and that his <hi>Bringers-up</hi> are in the room of the <hi>Bringers-up</hi> of the <hi>Front half-files,</hi> then he may proceed in this, or the like kind, commanding them to counter-march their Front and Reer into the midſt; which being performed, they will ſtand in ſome pretty way of reducing, after facing them to the Front, where he meets with his <hi>Bringers-up,</hi> in ſtead of his <hi>File-leaders;</hi> which by one Counter-march will bring them up again into the Front. Yet perhaps the <hi>Flankers</hi> have inter-changed ground with the middle <hi>File-leaders,</hi> if ſo, then counter-march their <hi>Flanks</hi> into the midſt, and face them to the <hi>Front;</hi> and if it happen that the right <hi>Flank</hi> is become the left, and the left; the right: then counter-march their <hi>Ranks</hi> to any hand, and after face them to the firſt Front they are reduced. And farther take this for a generall rule, that when <hi>Files, Ranks,</hi> or <hi>Counter-march</hi> to any ſtand, command them to counter-march to the contrary, and it will reduce them, or counter-marching your Front and Reer into the midſt, counter-marching of them back again from the midſt, will bring each man into his proper place again, the ſame rule being obſerved, reduceth the <hi>flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> or <hi>Front</hi> and <hi>Reer half-files</hi> counter-marching of them from the midſt.</p>

                     <hi>Counter-marches,</hi> rightly conſidered, branch themſelves forth into theſe three particulars.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Macedonian</hi> is a <hi>Counter-march</hi> of gaining ground, for that it leaveth the ground it formerly ſtood upon, and in lieu thereof taketh the ground before the <hi>front,</hi> and turneth their aſpects unto the <hi>reer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> is a <hi>Counter-march</hi> of loſing ground, for that it leaveth the ground it firſt ſtood upon, and in room thereof taketh the ground which is behind the <hi>reer,</hi> thither likewiſe altering the Souldiers aſpects.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chorean</hi> is a <hi>Counter-march</hi> maintaining ground, keeping the ground the <hi>Battalia</hi> formerly ſtood upon, every Souldier taking anothers place, it likewiſe turns the Aſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>reere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee (for all their great varietie which latter ages have invented) they conſiſt but of three ſorts or kinds, either <hi>maintaining, gaining,</hi> or <hi>loſing</hi> of ground, and may bee performed (as I ſaid before) either by intire or diviſionall <hi>Counter-marches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may now be expected that I declare unto the Souldier the meaning of each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Counter-march,</hi> briefly, therefore, thus. Files counter-marching is when every Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier followeth his <hi>Leader,</hi> ranks counter-marching is when every Souldier followeth his ſide man, whether it be to the right-hand or to the left: Front and reer half-files counter-marching is, ſometimes when every particular Souldier followeth his <hi>Leader</hi> or his <hi>Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger up,</hi> or elſe when they follow their half-file leaders, or their Bringers-up of the Front half-files, or the like: Right and left <hi>half-ranks</hi> counter-marching is, when every Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in the <hi>ranke</hi> followeth the outmoſt men upon the right and left, or when they ſhall follow their inſide right and left hand men, or the like: What hath hitherto been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken may be ſufficient both for the inſtruction and direction of any diſcreet ſouldier; I come in the next place to ſet them all before them as they lie in Order.</p>

Wherefore, take notice of two ſorts, <hi>Wheelings angular,</hi> and <hi>Wheelings</hi> on the <hi>Center,</hi> (which latter is commonly called the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his <hi>wheeling)</hi> being acted, or performed by the Souldier two ſeverall ways, that is to ſay, <hi>Intire,</hi> or <hi>Diviſionall</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Intire Wheelings</hi> to the <hi>Angles,</hi> are when the Souldiers turn their <hi>Aſpects</hi> from the <hi>front<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> proper to either of the <hi>Flanks,</hi> or <hi>Reer,</hi> whereby they may give the winde, or Sun, or ſome like advantage, bringing their beſt Souldiers thither for to encounter an Enemy. For the better performance of this <hi>Motion,</hi> it will be convenient to cloſe <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Files</hi> into the midſt to order, and to keep their due diſtance both in <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>file,</hi> obſerving in their <hi>Ranks</hi> their right and left-hand men, and following their <hi>Leaders,</hi> always conforming themſelves in their <hi>Motion</hi> to the moſt commendable <hi>Poſture,</hi> which is <hi>Pikes advanced,</hi> and <hi>Muskets poyſed. Wheeling</hi> the Battail on the <hi>Center,</hi> is when they are ſo ſtraightened with ground, that they have not room to <hi>wheel</hi> to the right or left, as in the former, which gaineth as much more ground before the <hi>front,</hi> as formerly they ſtood on; this <hi>wheeling</hi> brings their beſt Souldiers to either of the <hi>flanks,</hi> or <hi>Reer;</hi> I could wiſh that this <hi>wheeling</hi> were more oftner practiſed amongſt us, for by it the Souldiers are better kept together in their <hi>Motion,</hi> being not ſo apt to flie out, as in the former</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diviſionall Wheelings</hi> (provided they have ſufficient number of men) are of ſingular good uſe to encounter ſeverall Enemies at one and the ſame time, which the <hi>front</hi> of our <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> bringing our beſt Souldiers for to skirmiſh with them.

                  <p>Theſe are all the <hi>intire</hi> and <hi>diviſionall Wheelings,</hi> that have hitherto been practiſed by any, according to my beſt obſervation; there are other <hi>Wheelings</hi> which may properly be term'd <hi>Doublings,</hi> which I have placed amongſt the <hi>Doublings,</hi> where they more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong. Now if any ſhall demand of me a reaſon why I have omitted the <hi>Reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> to each perticuler <hi>Command;</hi> my anſwer thereunto is eaſie, for as in the <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marches,</hi> ſo in theſe, they may be reduced by three or four words of Command, except a Commander ſhall of ſet purpoſe keep them off from the ſame; to make ſome experiment, after any <hi>wheeling</hi> is performed, face them after to their firſt <hi>Front,</hi> and command them to even their <hi>ranks,</hi> and ſtraighten their <hi>files,</hi> they will be as at firſt; and unto what hand ſoever they <hi>wheeled,</hi> command them to <hi>wheel</hi> to the contrary hand, and they will be reduced unto the firſt <hi>front,</hi> or what part is <hi>wheeled</hi> off by <hi>Diviſion, wheel</hi> them inward again from that place, and it will eaſily reduce them. Thus you ſee that it is almoſt impoſſible for a <hi>Leader</hi> to be out, unleſſe he be extreamly ignorant, therefore he need not fear to venter far in the progreſſe of them, before he ſhall reduce them, provided he uſe no <hi>Doublings:</hi> which if he ſhall, great care muſt be had that he be not put to a ſtand; for the prevention whereof, let him look back unto thoſe <hi>doublings</hi> by <hi>wheelings,</hi> wherein one doth reduce another, where he may finde ſome remedie to help himſelfe forth again.</p>

                  <p>Theſe firings may as well be performed to both the <hi>flanks,</hi> as to one, the Body being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced accordingly, which would make many <hi>firings</hi> more, but theſe already ſet down, may be ſufficient for any ingenious capacity to work upon for the preſent, obſerving this rule, that in every <hi>firing</hi> he ſhall make uſe in time of his Exerciſe, he may reduce them by another, which will be more pleaſing to the Souldier, by reaſon of the great variety it affords unto them. And now, in the laſt place, I know it will be expected, that I ſhould ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the uſe of <hi>firings:</hi> wherefore briefly thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firings</hi> to the <hi>front</hi> marching, or moving, when we either purſue after, or approach to an Enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firings</hi> to the <hi>front,</hi> maintaining ground when two Bodies encounter one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firings</hi> to the <hi>front,</hi> loſing ground, when either we are forced thereunto by neceſſity, or that we do it out of policy, to draw the Enemy into a train, or ſnare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firings</hi> to the <hi>Reer</hi> marching, when we are purſued by an Enemy, yet would continue our March untill we have gained ſome place of importance, or advantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firings</hi> to the <hi>Reer</hi> upon a <hi>Stand,</hi> when we are compelled thereunto by the violent purſuit of an Enemy; or elſe when we have gained a place of advantage of ground, or have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the winde or Sun, whereby we are the better able to encounter with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firings</hi> to the <hi>flank,</hi> or <hi>flanks</hi> marching, when we are aſſaulted by ſome <hi>Ambuſcado</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly placed to hinder our paſſage; or ſuppoſing two Armies are marching to one and the ſame place, a river being betwixt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firings</hi> to <hi>flank</hi> or <hi>flanks</hi> ſtanding when the Enemy chargeth on with a reſolution to cut off or divide part of the Army from the other.</p>
                  <p>Having thus briefly ſet down ſeverall <hi>firings</hi> to <hi>front, reer,</hi> and both <hi>flanks,</hi> with their uſes either marching, or ſtanding, I hold it convenient in the next place to give ſome ſhort directions in time of Battail, both to the Officers, and their Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the <hi>Drummers</hi> have a vigilant eye upon their Commanders, whoſe voices are drown'd by the loud thundering of the <hi>Cannon,</hi> or <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> as alſo by the <hi>neighing</hi> of Horſes, or the lamentable cries of the <hi>maim'd</hi> and wounded Souldiers, at which time the <hi>Leaders Staffe, half-Pike,</hi> or what elſe he carries in his hand may be ſufficient for to inſtruct them to continue their charge, retreat, or elſe to charge home.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the <hi>Serjeants</hi> be carefull in time of Battail, that their Souldiers be at their due diſtance of order both in <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>file,</hi> and that upon their <hi>firings,</hi> whether they be by <hi>forlorns</hi> either of <hi>files,</hi> or <hi>ranks</hi> drawn forth, or otherwiſe by Diviſions, they ſee them neatly and handſomly perform'd by <hi>cocking</hi> their <hi>matches,</hi> and preſenting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lower then breſt-high, and after <hi>uncocking</hi> and returning them, wheeling off either to the right, left, or both, falling in the <hi>Reer</hi> of themſelves, or elſe where as ſhall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in an orderly manner, whereby they may decently come up again to <hi>fire</hi> againſt the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the Souldiers <hi>preſent</hi> and give <hi>fire</hi> upon their <hi>Reſts,</hi> not uſing that ſloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſture of popping their <hi>Matches</hi> into the <hi>Pan,</hi> their <hi>Muskets</hi> being on their left ſides, which is not only hurtfull unto themſelves, but much endangers their fellow-Souldiers, and by ſo doing, they ſcarce or ever do any execution againſt an Enemy. But here I meet with an objection framed by the Souldiers after this manner; our <hi>Reſts</hi> are of little or no uſe unto us in time of skirmiſhing, fit they are, we confeſſe, in the <hi>Military Gardens,</hi> but in time of Battail both troubleſome and cumberſome unto us, to whom I reply, what if they be a little cumberſome at the firſt, muſt they therefore be rejected, and careleſly thrown away, nay, rather they ought frequently to practiſe themſelves in the uſe thereof, which if they did, they would finde the ſame very ſerviceable unto them in time of skirmiſhing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they fire better, and in a more comely and gracefull way, far more ſecuring both themſelves, and fellow-ſouldiers from danger, and likewiſe upon their March, it is both a help and ſupport unto them.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:40901:40"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, their eyes ought likewiſe in time of Battail to be fixed ſtedfaſtly upon their <hi>Captain,</hi> always conforming to him in Poſture when he ſhall prepare to charge or retreat, and likewiſe they ought to be knowing and well verſt in the ſeverall <hi>beats</hi> of the <hi>Drum,</hi> which if well obſerved by all, there would not be ſo much confuſion in time of Battail amongſt them, as many times by ſad experience hath been found, when diſregarding their Officers commands, and the beating of the <hi>Drums,</hi> they ignorantly and raſhly run on in a diſorderly manner, by which means they have cut off their own Officers and fellow-ſouldiers, many times more then they have dangered the enemy.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee what great neceſſity there is of inſtructing and training up the Souldiers in their Poſtures, and how requiſite it is to conforme themſelves to their Officers in time of Battail, performing thereby better execution againſt their Enemies; and by their decent and comely array preſerve themſelves from imminent dangers and perils.</p>
                  <p>The Souldiers having now all the ground-worke of the exerciſing a body of men, laid down before them, in the next place he labours to make experiment thereof, but being no Officer he cannot attein thereunto without ſpeciall leave from his Superiours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (being a <hi>File-leader)</hi> he craves leave for to exerciſe his ſingle <hi>File</hi> both in their <hi>Poſtures</hi> and <hi>Motions,</hi> contenting himſelfe for preſent with that ſmall number whereby he is able to run through many plain things of <hi>Diſtances, Facings, Doublings, Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchings</hi> and <hi>Wheelings.</hi> But being not fully ſatisfied, he preſumes upon the former favour had from his Superiours to goe on to make every man in his <hi>File</hi> a <hi>File-leader,</hi> firſt, by <hi>ſucceſſion,</hi> and after (being not called away by the <hi>beat</hi> of the <hi>Drum,</hi> or by his Officers to lead up his <hi>File,</hi> and to joyne into a Body) according unto <hi>Dignity,</hi> and after endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to reduce them again by proper words of command.</p>
                  <p>This liberty being granted at convenient times unto a <hi>File-leader,</hi> much indeers the Souldiers good affections unto their Officers, and is a means whereby many others are brought in to be true lovers of Military Exerciſes, as being much taken and well pleaſed with the ſight of the former things. And therefore, I could wiſh, that they were not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after prevented, as formerly I have obſerved by the malice of ſome, who have had places of command beſtowed upon them, more through favour or by reaſon of their riches, then for any worth or deſert found in them: They perhaps hold it a great diſparagement unto them to be eclipſed, but a judicious and diſcreet Captain accounts it a great honour to lead ſuch gallant men that are as able, and as well knowing as himſelf.</p>

                  <p>Although I have here ſet down words of Command to make every man a <hi>File-leader,</hi> both by <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Dignity;</hi> a Commander is not thereby tied up, but may if he pleaſe, practiſe the ſame upon a whole Company, altering but a little ſome words of Command; As for example, we cannot ſay in a <hi>file,</hi> double your <hi>ranks,</hi> there being none, untill there be ſome other <hi>files</hi> joyned thereunto, and therefore if we intend a doubling by a ſingle <hi>file,</hi> we command it to <hi>rank</hi> two to the right or left, which in a Company muſt be expreſt <hi>Ranks</hi> to the right or left double. Thus you ſee with a little alteration every man is brought up into the <hi>Front,</hi> either by <hi>ſucceſſion,</hi> or <hi>dignity,</hi> whether the <hi>files</hi> be even numbers or odd, great bodies or ſmall. But here by the way, I muſt crave pardon to ſpeak ſomething in commendation of theſe <hi>Doublings,</hi> in anſwer to them that accounts them but <hi>toys;</hi> to whom I will be ſo bold as to tell them that it is not for want of ignorance, they ſo ſlightly eſteem of them, for were they truly knowing in the Art of <hi>Drilling,</hi> they muſt of force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe abundance of variety in them, affording much delight to him that ſhall command, and great content unto them that are commanded, perceiving themſelves to be made <hi>file-leaders</hi> by the skill and worth of their <hi>Leaders.</hi> And, beſides, there may be juſt cauſe (at one time or other) many times to alter the <hi>ranks,</hi> exchanging the one for the other, bringing thereby their beſt deſerving Souldiers into the chiefeſt places of honour, and caſting others into their rooms at the diſcretion of the Commander. Therefore, I could wiſh, all <hi>Leaders</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever to be well skill'd and verſt in theſe <hi>Doublings,</hi> the frequent practiſe whereof will make them more apt in the Exerciſe of more difficult things in the <hi>Art Military.</hi> To which ingenious ſtudy I leave them, and in the next place proceed to ſhew them ſeverall <hi>figures</hi> of <hi>Battail</hi> to be performed by ſingle <hi>files,</hi> conſiſting of ſeverall <hi>Depths</hi> of men.</p>

                  <p>THe great plenty, and variety of matter, that may be performed in the exerciſing of a ſingle <hi>file,</hi> makes me wonder at the ignorance of thoſe who are famed abroad for able knowing Souldiers, who after they have paſſed over the <hi>Poſtures,</hi> are at a Stand, as if there were nothing elſe to be done. with the ſame.

                  <p>But here, me thinks, I heare ſome ſay, of what uſe are your <hi>figures?</hi> ſeeing for the moſt part, in pitcht Battails, or skirmiſhing in the field, they commonly fire one again ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Squares,</hi> or by <hi>Forlornes,</hi> drawn forth from the Body, and being relieved, return into their places again. To whom, I anſwer, that in one reſpect it is true, there being ſcarce any pitcht Battail in the field fought in theſe latter times, but it hath been with even <hi>fronts,</hi> who ever are firſt ingaged, whether it be by <hi>Diviſions</hi> drawn off by way of <hi>Forl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore take this for a generall rule, that there was never any pitcht Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, but there were Reſerves appointed out unto all the parts thereof, whereby they might bring off, and at time of need relieve each other; and if ſo, certainly, they muſt of neceſſity carry along with them ſeverall forms, and <hi>figures</hi> of <hi>Battail,</hi> according to the diſcretion of the <hi>Major-Generall,</hi> or other Commanders in chiefe whom it ſhall concern. It will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be expedient (ſince there is a neceſſity of <hi>figures</hi> of <hi>Battail,</hi> and for the ſetting a part of <hi>Diviſions</hi> for the relieving of each other) for every Commander that will be truly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to have always ſome imprinted in his memory, that in time of need, he may not be to ſeek, or wanting in them. To which purpoſe, I have collected ſome few, putting them to their view, being formerly-practiſed by me, for the ſatisfaction of thoſe loving Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen which have private Meetings in <hi>London;</hi> but more eſpecially for thoſe of the <hi>Town-ditch,</hi> unto whom I am moſt eſpecially bound.

                  <p>The <hi>Artillery Garden</hi> deſerves the firſt place, in reſpect it is the greateſt Meeting, from whence, as it were out of a <hi>Nurſery</hi> have been tranſplanted many able knowing ſouldiers both at home and in forreign Countries to the great honour of our Nation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Military Garden</hi> is famous likewiſe for the great improvement of diverſe worthy perſons of quality daily thither reſorting, whoſe excellent skill in <hi>Military</hi> Exerciſes hath raiſed many of them to high preferment here at home, and places of honourable command abroad. The <hi>Captains</hi> in chiefe of theſe <hi>Academies</hi> are <hi>Major Generall Skippon,</hi> and <hi>Major Henry Tyllier,</hi> which later was the firſt that ever ſhew'd in the <hi>Military Garden</hi> (of which I am a member) the marching of the Souldiers in a <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all</hi> way, whoſe great pains amongſt us deſerves much honour and high commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſhewing unto us ſuch variety of matter in a Souldier-like way, as was never before ſeen, by any member thereof.</p>
                  <p>Not to ecclipſe the fore-mentioned <hi>Private Meetings</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> but to give them that due which belongs unto them, they likewiſe are of great honour and ſame for their frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing of their Souldiers in the handling of their <hi>Arms,</hi> whether it be of the <hi>Pike,</hi> or <hi>Musket,</hi> and inſtructing them in the knowledge of <hi>Drilling,</hi> and drawing up of Companies,

My hearty wiſhes therefore that all and every one of them may be propt up, and ſupported to all ages, that when need ſhall require, we may draw from theſe <hi>fountains</hi> ſuch skilfull and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Commanders, and Officers as may be, as it were, a <hi>Bulwark</hi> to this our Nation.</p>
                  <p>Not to dwell any longer upon this diſcourſe, I come, therefore, briefly to ſet forth ſeverall Exerciſes (formerly practiſed by me amongſt thoſe loving Gentlemen of <hi>Town-ditch)</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſuall numbers there appearing, whether they be great or ſmall, practiſed for the moſt part with 24 or 32 men, and ſomtimes (although ſeldome) with 64 men, unleſſe it were upon generall days, when they were drawn forth into the field; at ſuch times, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, there might be an appearance of greater numbers, as 120 and upwards.</p>
                  <p>My purpoſe, therefore is to <hi>pitch</hi> upon, and to make uſe of all and every one of theſe numbers, making 12 Exerciſes, dividing them by threes, untill I have run over them all, conceiving them ſufficient for the induſtrious to gather from thence matter enough for his intended Exerciſe. And for the more enabling of them, I ſhall indeavour (in theſe curious times) to walk a long in as plain a way as poſſibly may be, giving directions unto all Words of Command, for the better performance of the ſame; wiſhing all my loving fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſouldiers to conceive well of my good meaning intended to them: deſiring withall to be rightly informed of what part ſoever they fall upon, that they proceed leaſurely and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in the ſame, which will not only be an incouragement unto the Authour from whom they gather their Exerciſes, but will bring much prayſes and commendation to themſelves; But to leave every one to their own beſt thoughts, whileſt I proceed to practiſe what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſed concerning the ſeverall Exerciſes following.</p>

To leave this diſcourſe not pleaſing to ſome, let the Commander draw forth one <hi>file</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> and double it by the <hi>half-file,</hi> and ſend a <hi>Serjeant</hi> to fetch the <hi>Colours,</hi> and after cloſing his <hi>ranks</hi> and <hi>files</hi> to order, he may begin to make ſome alteration in the exerciſing of them in their Motions, ſpending his time altogether upon <hi>Inverſion</hi> and <hi>Converſion.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E that ſhall be deſirous to be truly knowing in this point of <hi>Military Diſcipline,</hi> in the drawing up of <hi>Regiments,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of leſſer or greater Bodies, as in ſome 6, other 7, 8, 10, or 12 Companies, they muſt be drawn up into <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia,</hi> either in one two or three <hi>Squadrons</hi> (or grand divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions) of <hi>Pikes flanked</hi> with <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> having alwayes in the <hi>Reer</hi> a ſufficient number of <hi>Muskettiers</hi> for the guard of the <hi>Bagage, Cannon,</hi> or to be <hi>Convoys</hi> for to convey <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition</hi> and <hi>Victuall</hi> to the reſt of their fellows: Who are to be drawn forth (by the diſcretion of the <hi>Major)</hi> from each particular Company according to their ſeverall ſtrengths, as in greater Companies more <hi>files</hi> then in thoſe which be leſſer, ordering them timely reliefe, whereby the ſeverall duties amongſt the Souldiers throughout the <hi>Regiment</hi> by an equall way may take their turns. Now for as much as the true ſtating of the dignities of every particular Officer, in the opinions of many, differ very much, and our former <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary</hi> Authors have been very ſparing in their pains, in ſetting down their due places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; I ſhall, for the ſatisfaction of thoſe which deſire to be rightly inform'd, collect out of the many former practiſed abroad, and at home, one good way to perfect it.</p>
                  <p>But here, by the way, I muſt crave pardon from the courteous Reader by reaſon I foreſee certain objections like <hi>rubs</hi> or <hi>blocks,</hi> lying in my way to digreſſe a little from my intended purpoſe, to give anſwers unto each of them, which are firſt, that I ſeem to ſlighten the pains of former Authors.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it will be a means to occaſion much idleneſſe in the Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that it is too great a knowledge to be laid open to their view.</p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:40901:83"/>
                  <p>To the firſt I anſwer, that the reaſon, as I conceive, why they have been ſo ſparing of their pains in this kind, was not for want of abilities, or knowledge amongſt any of them, whoſe works for the moſt part I highly honour and eſteem, but rather believe that they left it forth for the curious ſearch of ſuch who are called unto <hi>Field-</hi>officers places, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well that before they are capable of that preferment they muſt be good proficients in this part of <hi>Military Exerciſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2 Although many that know but a little, may be puft up with high conceits of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, conceiving what the Authour hath done, 'twere eaſie for any man to performe the ſame; yet to them of riper judgements, the more variety in this kind is preſented to their view, the more painfull they are in the curious practiſe thereof, thinking every moment loſt which is not ſpent in the ſearching after, and informing of their judgments in this point of <hi>Military</hi> Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>If it had not been for the worthie paines and labours of our anceſtors publiſhed to the view of the world, this our age might have been ignorant both in this, and all other Sciences, for from them we borrowed our firſt light, God putting it in their hearts to publiſh their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gifts to after generations, which though at this day much refined, yet for our firſt grounds and principles we are beholding unto them. Therefore, give me leave, according as God hath inabl'd me, not to conceale or keep back any thing which may concern the good and welfare of my country; for, I conceive, there is none worthie to receive benefit from thoſe that have gone before him, if he conceales that good to ſuch as ſhall come after him. And if I happen to lie under the hard cenſure of ſome for my paines, it makes no matter, ſo the major part receive benefit thereby, for as I gathered ſomwhat of others: ſo my deſire is that others may doe the like by me.</p>
                  <p>The opinions of Souldiers in the drawing up of <hi>Regiments</hi> are very various both in their formes and figures, according to the cuſtome of their Countries, commands of their Generals or Officers in cheife, which nevertheleſſe may prove very good and ſerviceable when need ſhall require, I ſhall therefore for the ſatisfaction of the ingenuous ſouldier ſet before them the beſt collections drawn from them all, ſuch as may be moſt uſefull for to fight againſt the enemy, according to the ſituation of the place, the number of men, and aptneſſe of ground to contain them, which in the next place comes to be handled.</p>

                  <p>In the next place, there are no more to place, but the fifth and ſixth worth, who are the ſecond and third <hi>Captains:</hi> and therefore ſince it is the firſt place of honour among the <hi>Captains</hi> in a <hi>Regiment,</hi> to lead the firſt Body or Stand of <hi>Pikes,</hi> it muſt then conſequently follow, that the ſecond place of honour muſt be to lead the ſecond grand <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Pikes;</hi> and therefore the fifth worth is brought into, and placed between the ſecond and third, that he may aptly ſtand there to to lead the ſecond Body of <hi>Pikes;</hi> wherein the <hi>Lieutenant Collonel,</hi> the <hi>Major,</hi> and his own <hi>Colours</hi> are placed: ſo that there remaines no more but the ſixth worth, or youngeſt <hi>Captain</hi> to place, who is drawn up between the <hi>Collonel,</hi> and eldeſt <hi>Captain.</hi> Now if we ſhall further proceed to ballance it more cleerly, conſider them by dividing them by two's, in their places, as firſt, we will begin with the <hi>Collonel,</hi> the firſt worth, who hath joyned to him the youngeſt <hi>Captain,</hi> which is the ſixt worth, and they two make the number (7) then compare the <hi>Lieutenant-Collonel,</hi> who is the ſecond worth, unto the ſecond <hi>Captain</hi> joyn'd with him; which is the fifth worth, and they make a like the ſame number; after compare the <hi>Major,</hi> and eldeſt <hi>Captain,</hi> who are drawn up into the midſt of the <hi>Regiment,</hi> whoſe places carry the third and fourth worth, and their number is ſutable with the reſt. And thus much may be ſpoken in generall, now I ſhall come more perticulerly to give further ſatisfaction both for them, and for all the reſt; and therefore I will give reaſons for the placing of the Officers of the firſt grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and cleering that, the ſecond will quickly be laid open to the view.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>More perticuler reaſons for the placing of the</hi> Captains, <hi>and</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, <hi>of the firſt grand</hi> Diviſion.</head>
                  <p>IN this grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> there is the <hi>Collonel,</hi> the eldeſt <hi>Captain,</hi> and the youngeſt drawn up into the midſt, and they having each of them <hi>Lieutenants,</hi> take notice therefore of theſe reaſons for their placing thus. That always upon ſuch ſmall Bodies as theſe, the firſt honour is ever placed upon the right, and the ſecond, upon the left, and that which remaines, muſt of neceſſity be drawn up into the midſt; they ſtanding all a breſt. Theſe three Companies being ordered into a right and left <hi>Flank,</hi> and one Stand of <hi>Pikes,</hi> or <hi>Van-guard, Reer-ward,</hi> or <hi>Main-battail,</hi> as they may be term'd, the reaſons follow for the thus ſtanding of the Officers, whether marching all even a breſt, or upon a ſtand; it is the <hi>Collonels</hi> proper place to be on the head or midſt of his grand <hi>Diviſion;</hi> which is his chiefeſt place of ſecurity, and where he ought to fight; for ſtanding there, the other may more conveniently repair unto him for their orders, as occaſion ſhall require. Now the <hi>Collonel</hi> being a Field-Officer, is not abſolutely tied to any one place to fight, as the reſt are, many occaſions calling him from thence; the eldeſt <hi>Captain</hi> therefore is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take charge of the Body of <hi>Pikes,</hi> whether it be upon a March to lead them, or upon a Stand to fight them, he ought never to forſake them, but upon ſpeciall command from his <hi>Collonel,</hi> or other Field-Officers. Now the reaſon why the firſt Body of <hi>Pikes</hi> is the moſt honourableſt place to lead, is, as I conceive, becauſe the <hi>Collonels Colours</hi> are there
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40901:84"/> 
                     <hi>flying,</hi> and beſides being the more ancienter Armes, far more honour it is to lead them; for moſt commonly the gallanteſt men of the <hi>Infantry</hi> deſire rather to <hi>trail Pikes,</hi> then to carry <hi>Muskets;</hi> Moreover, it hath been a conſtant practiſe in moſt places, that the eldeſt <hi>Captain</hi> ſhould have that place to lead on foot, although many times his <hi>Collonel</hi> being on horſ-back, may be a little before him. Having ſpoken of theſe two, it remaines to ſpeak ſomthing of the youngeſt <hi>Captain,</hi> who is appointed either upon the Marching all a breſt, or upon a Stand, to take charge of the <hi>Reer-ward,</hi> or left <hi>Flank</hi> of the firſt grand <hi>Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to fight them, but upon the long March, it is more honourable for him to fall down in the <hi>Reer,</hi> and to bring up his own <hi>Lieutenant</hi> comming up into his place; for it is greater honour (though many times not believed) to bring up a grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> then to lead a <hi>Sub-diviſion.</hi> In the next place, it may be ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Captain Lieutenants</hi> place is too honourable to lead the <hi>Van-guard,</hi> to which I anſwer, that the <hi>Collonel</hi> himſelfe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned thither; for upon the long-March he draws off the <hi>Van-guard,</hi> and leads them himſelfe, being attended on <hi>horſ-back</hi> by the <hi>Martiall</hi> and <hi>Quarter-maſter</hi> of his own <hi>Regiment.</hi> Now leading away the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> of his own perticuler Company, the <hi>Captain Lieutenant</hi> being ſubſervient unto him, marcheth a foot upon the head of the firſt <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and takes charge of them, as aſſiſting to his <hi>Collonel,</hi> and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, if he receives no command to the contrary, when they are all drawn up again even a breſt, it concerning him eſpecially to be there reſident in the abſence of his <hi>Collonel,</hi> for the better regulating of them. The eldeſt <hi>Captains Lieutenant</hi> is always placed in the <hi>Reer</hi> of the <hi>Pikes,</hi> either upon a <hi>Stand,</hi> or upon a <hi>March,</hi> it being very honourable unto him to bring up a grand <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Pikes.</hi> The third <hi>Captains Lieutenant</hi> is ordered to bring up the left <hi>Flank,</hi> except it be upon the long-March, and then he is to exchange places with his own <hi>Captain.</hi> There is yet one place vacant, which is to bring up the right <hi>Flank,</hi> and the <hi>Captain Lieutenants Bringer-up,</hi> many times through courteſie is called a <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> therefore a <hi>Major</hi> may be ſo courteous as to aſſigne him that place; and here I ſhall conclude with the reaſons of the places of the Officers of the firſt grand <hi>Diviſion.</hi>

                  <p>ALthough the <hi>Collonel</hi> is Commander in chiefe, yet his diſcretion is ſuch, as to leave the ordering of places to his <hi>Major;</hi> and as he takes charge of the firſt grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> ſo he leaves the ſecond to his <hi>Lieutenant Collonel,</hi> who ſtands upon the head or midſt of the ſame, being drawn up all even a breſt; and many times leads the ſecond grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> as the <hi>Collonel</hi> doth the firſt, as was the practiſe in the <hi>Regiments</hi> upon their March, under the command of the <hi>Earl of Eſſex, Generall</hi> of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> Forces. To ſuch as ſhall approve of this way (which may be very good) they ſhall not need to counter-march the <hi>Ranks</hi> of the <hi>Lieutenant Collonell,</hi> as is before expreſſed, before the drawing up of the <hi>Lieutenants Collonels</hi> Company, but draw them up on the right of that <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and to counter-march the <hi>Ranks</hi> of the <hi>Majors,</hi> and draw his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany up on the left. But I ſhall leave that to the liberty of thoſe that ſhall beſt fancie this kinde, and proceed to that which is of more uſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond grand <hi>Diviſion</hi> ſtanding in an even range with the firſt, it will be convenient for the <hi>Lieutenant Collonel</hi> to be upon the head thereof. As concerning the <hi>Major,</hi> he being an Officer at will, hath no certain place aſſign'd unto him, by reaſon of his moving, as occaſion ſhall require, to both <hi>Diviſions,</hi> whereby he may give orders unto them all, minding the good order of the <hi>Regiment,</hi> throughout every part thereof. But if he will take his place, to march in the propereſt place for him, if they march all a breſt, will be in the <hi>Front,</hi> between the <hi>Collonel</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant Collonel,</hi> but in the <hi>long-march</hi> in the midſt of both grand <hi>Diviſions,</hi> whereby he may have freer acceſſe unto them both, whoſe vigilant eye in the well ordering of the <hi>Regiment</hi> is chiefly concern'd, obſerving all the paſſages, whether there be need of ſub-dividing their <hi>Diviſions;</hi> and if at any time they ſhall be divided, when there is ground ſufficient enough, he muſt give order again for the drawing them all up even a breſt, it being far more gracefull to the <hi>Regiments</hi> marching. In the next place, the ſecond <hi>Captain</hi> may claime it as his due, to lead the ſecond Body
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40901:85"/> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> as the eldeſt <hi>Captain</hi> challengeth the firſt, and the reaſon given for his place, may ſuffice for both: The eldeſt <hi>Lieutenant</hi> in this grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> which is the <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants Collonels Lieutenant,</hi> is aſſigned unto that place, where he is ſet down for to be an aſſiſtant there-unto his <hi>Lieuteaant Collonell,</hi> for the well regulating of his men which march in the <hi>Reer,</hi> as the <hi>Captain Lieutenant</hi> is to the <hi>Collonels</hi> men, who march in the <hi>

                        </gap>ront,</hi> and his <hi>Lieutenant Collonel</hi> bringing up the whole <hi>Regiment</hi> is the ſecond place of honour. Some may conceive the <hi>Majors Lieutenant</hi> hath too great a place of honour in leading the <hi>Van</hi> of the ſecond grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> to which I anſwer, if the <hi>Lieutenant Collonel</hi> marcheth not there himſelfe, but ſhall bring up the <hi>Regiment,</hi> certainly it muſt be cleer, that it is the <hi>Majors</hi> due, for to march there himſelfe at times convenient, and being ſo, there is good reaſon in his abſence his <hi>Lieutenant</hi> ſhould lead his men, or in his preſence to be thereas a helper unto him, for the well regulating of his men, as the other <hi>Lieutenants</hi> are to the other long <hi>Field-officers</hi> who every one of them according to their ſeverall places may have ſeverall occaſions to call them off, their <hi>Lieutenants</hi> therefore ought to be at hand, and to march with them in their places, whereby they may receive orders from them, and know how to act in their abſence concerning their own perticuler Souldiers. The ſecond <hi>Captains Lieutenant</hi> is ordered to bring up the ſecond Body of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which being a grand <hi>Diviſion</hi> it falls to him as due there, as the eldeſt <hi>Captains Lieutenant</hi> doth in the firſt, it being the greateſt place of honour that can be given him in the <hi>Reer</hi> next to the <hi>Leiutenant Collonel.</hi> Having ſpoken thus much concerning every <hi>Field-officer,</hi> the <hi>Captains,</hi> and their <hi>Lieutenants,</hi> where their places are to march, with the reaſons for the ſame, it will be expected to ſupply two places which are vacant in the <hi>Reer</hi> of the ſecond grand <hi>Diviſion;</hi> to which I anſwer upon the <hi>long-march</hi> the <hi>Lieutenant Collonel</hi> himſelfe moves down there, and brings up the <hi>Reer</hi> of the whole <hi>Regiment;</hi> and therefore it is left vacant for him, but then you will ſay there wants an Officer to bring up the <hi>Reer</hi> of that <hi>Diviſion,</hi> wherein the <hi>Majors Lieutenant</hi> is placed; to which I anſwer, that there is none remaining to do it, except it be the <hi>Majors Lieutenant</hi> himſelfe. For if the <hi>Major</hi> ſhall lead the ſecond grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> then his <hi>Lieutenant</hi> may move down to bring up that perticuler <hi>Diviſion</hi> for to ſupply the ſame, but in regard the <hi>Major</hi> (as hath been ſhewn before) hath many occaſions to call him off, it concerns his <hi>Lieutenant</hi> to keep his place which was firſt aſſigned unto him, to avoid the trouble of moving up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in his <hi>Majors</hi> abſence. Some are of opinion it would be convenient to place the <hi>Lieutenant Collonels</hi> eldeſt <hi>Serjeant</hi> there, but in my judgement it is very unhandſome to ſee any <hi>Halberteer,</hi> either to lead or bring up any <hi>Diviſion</hi> marching in a <hi>regimentall</hi> way, and rather then I ſhould do it, I would let it go unſupplied; but if he ſhall be there placed to bring up, his beſt way of marching, is either with a <hi>Pallizado,</hi> or <hi>Half-pike,</hi> and not with his <hi>Halberd.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> having ſtated all things according to the former directions, may if he pleaſe, either <hi>face, double, counter-march,</hi> or <hi>wheel,</hi> to <hi>Front, Reer,</hi> or both <hi>Flanks</hi> in every perticuler <hi>Diviſion.</hi> And may after <hi>fire</hi> them by way of <hi>Diviſions</hi> drawn off ten or twenty paces before the <hi>Front, firing</hi> them 7 or 8 times over, relieving them by other ſupplies, marching up into their ground. And may after <hi>face</hi> the <hi>Reer diviſions</hi> about, and <hi>fire</hi> them to <hi>Front</hi> and <hi>Reer</hi> on the ſame ground they ſtand, there being ſufficient intervalls for their <hi>wheeling</hi> off in the <hi>Reer</hi> of themſelves.

Their <hi>counter-marching</hi> of <hi>Files</hi> to the <hi>Reer</hi> gaineth no ground before the <hi>Front,</hi> in the <hi>Motion,</hi> but onely the room of one perticuler <hi>File</hi> upon the right; it preſerveth not the honour of the right and left-hand <hi>File-leader</hi> at one time by any one word of command unto any of their <hi>Motions</hi> to ſuch accidentall <hi>Fronts</hi> they ſhall make, but ever loſeth it to ſome, and gaineth it to others. And, therefore, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear cleerly unto any ingenious capacity, that the former <hi>wheelings</hi> cannot be accounted, or given in their <hi>Motions</hi> in that kind to the Souldiers for <hi>counter-marches,</hi> but by ſuch terms as in their place are ſet down.

                  <head>CHAP.

                  </head>
                  <p>IT hath been my obſervation in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Suburbs thereof, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 18 <hi>Regiments,</hi> nine of the <hi>Trained Bands,</hi> and nine of the <hi>Auxiliaries,</hi> that their <hi>Regiments</hi> in ſome have but ſix <hi>Companies;</hi> others, and that for the moſt part, ſeven, and again, in ſome, &amp; but a few to have eight <hi>Companies.</hi> I ſhall therefore for the better ſatisfaction of ſuch as remain unskill'd herein, go through them all, partly to ſhew the practiſe of this our City in their ſeverall <hi>drawings</hi> up, with the reaſons to confirme the ſame. And having paſſed over as much as is convenient, to ſatisfie any ingenuous Souldier concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the drawing up of ſix Companies in a <hi>regimentall</hi> way, with the confirmation and reaſons of every perticuler Officer, as he there ſtands, it may in many things give full light to this that follows of ſeven Companies. Yet, nevertheleſſe, for more fuller ſatisfaction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I ſhall ſhew the true manner hereof, that I may not be wanting to any Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that he ſhall receive thereby. Where, note for better order herein, that I have pitcht upon a perticuler number of men, although it may many times fall out ſo, that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40901:90"/> the <hi>Captaines</hi> Companies, and the <hi>Field-officers</hi> cannot be ſo full as I have here ſet down. Or again, it may chance to fall out (as in our <hi>Trained Bands</hi> of <hi>London)</hi> that they be a great deale fuller, as ſomtimes they are, for I have led a perticuler Company my ſelf upon a generall day being drawn into the <hi>

Yet, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, whether the Companies be great or ſmall, obſerve this generall rule, make two grand <hi>Diviſions,</hi> and <hi>ballance</hi> their number equal in both Arms, and make no more <hi>Subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> then what you have <hi>Captains</hi> to lead, and <hi>Lieutenants</hi> to bring up; and let the <hi>Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants</hi> March by the <hi>Flanks,</hi> and not preſume either to lead, or bring up any <hi>Diviſions,</hi> being conceived by moſt to be very improper. And again, if you <hi>fight</hi> the <hi>Regiment,</hi> let your <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers</hi> as neer as you can be equall alike in their <hi>Subdiviſions</hi> as they may moſt convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall out, whether four, five, or ſix a breſt, it makes no great matter, always leaving in time of <hi>fight,</hi> between ſuch number of <hi>Files</hi> ſix foot of ground <hi>intervall,</hi> for to wheel off their <hi>Ranks</hi> after they have <hi>fired.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſuppoſe, the whole <hi>Regiment</hi> were <hi>marching</hi> to their generall place of <hi>Randezvous;</hi> the <hi>Major</hi> being there before hand, attending the Companies comming in, he orders to the <hi>Collonels</hi> Company the moſt convenient place for their drawing up, and next to him the fourth <hi>Captains</hi> Company upon the left, and next to him the third <hi>Captain,</hi> and after him, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt or firſt <hi>Captain,</hi> which makes the firſt grand <hi>Diviſion.</hi> In the next place he orders the <hi>Lieutenant Collonels</hi> Company to be on the left of the whole <hi>Regiment,</hi> ſtanding in even <hi>Front</hi> with the <hi>Collonel,</hi> upon the right of him, the ſecond <hi>Captain</hi> is placed, and after him the <hi>Majors</hi> own Company, which makes up the ſecond grand <hi>Diviſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus far proceeded, let the <hi>Major</hi> command the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and <hi>Colours</hi> to advance forward ten paces, before the <hi>Front</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> then let him cloſe the <hi>Pikes</hi> of the firſt four Companies, to the right to order, and the <hi>Pikes</hi> of the laſt to the left to order, and the like of the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> in the <hi>Reer</hi> to thoſe hands to the ſame diſtance, then they will ſtand in four <hi>Diviſions;</hi> two of <hi>Pikes</hi> in the <hi>Front,</hi> and two of <hi>Mukettiers</hi> in the <hi>Reer.</hi> In the next place let him count how many <hi>Files</hi> of <hi>Pikes</hi> there are in each <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and he will finde in the <hi>Collonels Diviſion</hi> 26 <hi>Files,</hi> and in the <hi>Lieutenant Collonels</hi> but 22. To make theſe even, he muſt take off one <hi>file</hi> a piece from the youngeſt <hi>Captains,</hi> and bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the midſt of the <hi>Lieutenant Collonels Diviſion,</hi> and then he will make them equall, there being in each grand <hi>Diviſion</hi> 24 <hi>files</hi> of <hi>Pikes.</hi> The <hi>Pikes</hi> being made thus equall, let him move down into the <hi>Reer,</hi> and examine the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> where upon the right he will finde 52 <hi>files,</hi> and upon the left but 44; to make theſe even in number, he muſt take off one <hi>file</hi> a piece from the four Companies of the firſt grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> and lead them away up into the midſt of the ſecond, and then there will be in each grand <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers</hi> 48 <hi>files</hi> a piece. In the next place let him <hi>face</hi> them to the right and left outward, and move them to ſuch convenient <hi>diſtance,</hi> as he may after divide his <hi>Muskettiers</hi> into four <hi>Diviſions</hi> to move up, and <hi>flank</hi> the <hi>Pikes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being performed, he ought to appoint unto every <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant</hi> his place where to lead, and where to bring up, and what men upon all occaſions they are to <hi>fight.</hi> To which purpoſe, there being in the firſt grand <hi>Diviſion</hi> four <hi>Captains,</hi> there muſt be four places to lead, and four to bring up, and therefore having their four <hi>Colours</hi> upon the <hi>long-march,</hi> that Body of <hi>Pikes</hi> may be divided into two <hi>Diviſions,</hi> and to march with two <hi>Colours</hi> in the firſt <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which are to be led by the eldeſt <hi>Captain,</hi> and brought up by the <hi>Captains Lieutenants Bringer-up;</hi> the ſecond <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Pikes</hi> is to be led by the fourth <hi>Captain,</hi> and to be brought up by the eldeſt <hi>Captain Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> The <hi>Reer-guard</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers</hi> in this grand diviſion is to be led by the third <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and to be brought up by his <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> who upon the <hi>long-march</hi> his <hi>Captain</hi> if he pleaſeth, may exchange places, being more honour to him to be there to bring up, then to lead that Diviſion, as hath been formerly expreſt. As concerning the <hi>Captain Lieutenant</hi> his place is to be fixed according as in the Figure to lead the firſt Diviſion of Muskettiers, and to be brought up by the fourth <hi>Captains Lieutenant,</hi> but at ſuch time when they are drawn up all a breſt, they are to take their places as at firſt fixed, both in their leading, and bringing-up, as ſhall be ſet forth in the following Figure, with all their ſeverall places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereunto. As concerning all the reſt, they are placed in manner as was ſhewed in my diſcourſe of a <hi>Regiment</hi> conſiſting of ſix Companies.</p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:40901:90"/>
                  <p>But here it may be objected, that in the firſt grand <hi>Diviſion</hi> I have placed the <hi>Collonel,</hi> eldeſt <hi>Captain,</hi> third, and fourth, and by caſting up their number of dignity, we finde it to amount unto 18, and in the ſecond grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> the <hi>Lieutenant Collonel, Major,</hi> and ſecond <hi>Captain,</hi> whoſe number amounts but to 10: here we finde (ſay they) a great deal of difference, and alteration, your intentions principally tending to make them equall in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for certainly, where the greater number is, there is the leſſer dignity, and therefore a wrong unto that part where ever it ſo falls out.</p>
                  <p>To which, I anſwer, where there is no juſt exceptions to be made to the contrary, the former rule ought ever to be preſerved in the keeping an equall <hi>ballance</hi> of the number of dignity, but herein it doth not. For the <hi>Collonel</hi> ought always to have placed in his diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eldeſt <hi>Captain,</hi> who is to lead his <hi>colours,</hi> and the firſt Body of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which is the firſt place of honour among the <hi>Captains,</hi> and in the ſecond place the <hi>Majors</hi> Company is always drawn up, upon the out-moſt part, on the right of the <hi>Lieutenant Collonels</hi> grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> to carry an equall proportion of number, they being the ſecond, and third worth, unto that of the firſt, or fourth, as is in the <hi>Collonels.</hi> In the next place, the ſecond <hi>Captains</hi> turn comes to be regarded, who by the ſame rule, as the eldeſt <hi>Captain</hi> layes claim to carry the firſt honour, by leading the firſt Body of <hi>Pikes,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Collonels colours:</hi> ſo the ſecond <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> cannot expect any other, but to be placed to lead the ſecond Body of <hi>Pikes,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Lieut. Collonels colours.</hi> Now, there being an odd <hi>Captain,</hi> he muſt be either placed upon the right, or left, he is therefore thought in diſcretion to be rather placed with the <hi>Collonel</hi> in his Diviſion, that his <hi>colours</hi> may there flie, <hi>marching</hi> four together, being far more honour and gracefull, then that of three, as in the <hi>Lieutenant Collonels,</hi> and therefore where there is an honour in that kind which cannot be divided, it is very fit and requiſite to place and fix it with him that is the Commander in chiefe. As for number of men, both Diviſions are equall a like, and therefore, I conceive, what hath been ſpoken may take off all objections of this nature.</p>
                  <p>And now, according to my promiſe, I ſhall ſet forth the manner of the ſtanding of ſeven Companies in a <hi>regimentall</hi> way, with all the ſeverall places of honour appointed forth unto them, either <hi>marching,</hi> or ſtanding all even a breſt. If they be upon the <hi>long-march,</hi> they are to obſerve that manner ſet down in ſix Companies, onely to minde that alteration before expreſſed, the Figure of their drawing up, and the Officers ſtated in their proper places, follows in <hi>Folio</hi> 156.</p>
                  <p>From which Figure, I will draw up another, placing the Souldiers in <hi>Battalia,</hi> which may be very uſefull for them to <hi>fight</hi> upon.</p>

The middle diviſion of <hi>Muskettiers</hi> of thoſe three taken off before from each <hi>Flank</hi> move forward ſix foot cleer of the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part; the three middle-moſt diviſions of the five remaining upon each <hi>Flank,</hi> move up untill you ſtand ſix foot ſhort of the diviſions which are before you; the two out-moſt diviſions of the laſt three that moved, face outward, and <hi>march</hi> ſix foot cleer of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diviſions before them: the two remaining diviſions by the out-ſide of <hi>Pikes</hi> move in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, untill you ſtand ſtreight in the <hi>Reer</hi> with the two <hi>Front</hi> diviſions, facing all to their Leader, they will ſtand as is ſet forth unto your view in <hi>Folio</hi> 156.</p>

After he orders his own <hi>Lieutenant</hi> to be on the head of the third diviſion of <hi>Muskettiers;</hi> and the third diviſion of <hi>Pikes,</hi> he appoints to the fifth <hi>Captain,</hi> and to be brought up by his own <hi>Lieutenant;</hi> the fourth Diviſion of <hi>Pikes,</hi> is ordered to be the ſecond <hi>Captains</hi> place, and brought up by his own <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> the <hi>Lieutenant Collonels Lieutenant</hi> is appointed to the fourth and laſt diviſion of <hi>Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,</hi> the <hi>Lieutenant Collonel</hi> upon the <hi>long-march</hi> bringing up the whole <hi>Regiment.</hi> It might be ſuppoſed the <hi>Captain Lieutenant, Lieutenant Collonels</hi> and <hi>Majors Lieutenants,</hi> have too great places of <hi>honour,</hi> but to anſwer them all, their <hi>Captains</hi> being <hi>Field-officers</hi> and upon ſeverall occaſions moving off, their <hi>Lieutenants</hi> do officiate there in their rooms, and are but as aſſiſtants unto them, for likewiſe upon ſeverall occaſions they come to thoſe places themſelves to lead <hi>marching</hi> there before their <hi>Lieutenants.</hi> As concerning the placing of all the reſt of the other Officers, they lie cleerly, for as much as formerly hath been ſpoken in their proper places, without (as I conceive) the exceptions of any.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, upon the <hi>long-march,</hi> the <hi>Collonel</hi> draws off the firſt diviſion of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and leads them, <hi>marching</hi> ſome 12 foot before his <hi>Captain Lieutenant,</hi> and that divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is brought up by the fourth <hi>Captains Lieutenant,</hi> the <hi>colours marching</hi> two and two upon every diviſion, whereof the firſt is drawn off, and led by the firſt <hi>Captain,</hi> and brought up by the <hi>Captains Lieutenants</hi> and <hi>Bringer-up,</hi> the next diviſion of <hi>Pikes</hi> falling in the <hi>Reer</hi> of the firſt, and led by the fourth <hi>Captain,</hi> and brought up by the firſt <hi>Captains Lieutenant;</hi> the ſecond diviſion of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> is led by the third <hi>Captains Lieutenant,</hi> and brought up by his own <hi>Captain;</hi> the fourth or firſt diviſion of <hi>Muskettiers</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond grand Diviſion is led by the <hi>Major,</hi> when he pleaſeth, ſome 12 foot before his own <hi>Lieutenant;</hi> and the third diviſion of <hi>Pikes,</hi> is led by the fifth <hi>Captain,</hi> and brought up by his own <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> the fourth and laſt diviſion of <hi>Pikes</hi> is led by the ſecond <hi>Captain,</hi> and brought up by his own <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> the fourth and laſt diviſion of <hi>Muskettiers</hi> is by the <hi>Lieu.

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:40901:93"/> thus every <hi>Diviſion</hi> is to march by <hi>ſucceſſion,</hi> the one in the <hi>Reer</hi> of another, keeping 18 foot <hi>diſtance</hi> betwixt every <hi>Diviſion,</hi> untill they ſhall have room to <hi>march</hi> all even a breſt, and then with very little alteration with the third <hi>Captain,</hi> changing places, with his own <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> they are all to take their places again as at firſt.</p>
                  <p>Having now ſet forth the true <hi>dignity</hi> of every <hi>Captains</hi> and <hi>Lieutenants</hi> place, what men they ſhall take charge on to <hi>fight,</hi> where to lead, and where to bring up, I ſhall ſpare the figure in reſpect I ſhall ſhew (with very little alteration) the manner of <hi>drawing</hi> up and <hi>marching</hi> of divers <hi>Regiments</hi> that were under the command of the late <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>

                  <p>The firſt grand <hi>Diviſion</hi> in reſpect of every Officer and place, is to be ordered as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; only in the ſecond, there will be this ſmall alteration, the <hi>Lieutenant Collonels</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and the <hi>Majors</hi> are to interchange places, the reſt are to remain as they were, only with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For upon the <hi>long-march,</hi> as the <hi>Collonel</hi> leads the firſt grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> ſo it is conceiv'd by ſome, (they <hi>marching</hi> in two grand <hi>Diviſions</hi> ſome 20 paces diſtance from each other in manner of two <hi>regimentall marchings)</hi> that the <hi>Lieutenant Collonel</hi> ought to lead the ſecond. Next, let the firſt <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Pikes</hi> be led by the ſecond <hi>Captain,</hi> and to be brought up by the fifth <hi>Captains Lieutenant,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Pikes</hi> to be led by the fifth <hi>Captain,</hi> and brought up by the ſecond <hi>Captains Lieutenant;</hi> the laſt <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to be led by the <hi>Majors Lieutenant,</hi> and the <hi>Reer</hi> of the ſecond grand <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> being left for the <hi>Major</hi> to bring up, at ſuch time as with conveniency he may be ſpared. Therefore, to <hi>march</hi> thus, it being a very good way, and with very little alteration to be made, I was unwilling to paſſe it by, leaving it to the diſcretion of every ingenuous Souldier, to make uſe of which way he beſt pleaſeth, or likes of, whileſt I in the next place, ſhall ſet forth the <hi>Figure,</hi> which follows in <hi>page</hi> 161; affording more variety in the ſame.</p>

Lieutenant,</hi> I ſhall paſſe them over, having formerly ſpoken ſufficient to ſatisfie any Souldier therein. It follows therefore to ſpeak of the fourth <hi>Captains</hi> place, which is the next man of honour after the former, and therefore is placed to lead the ſecond <hi>diviſion</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which is more honour to him to lead there, then to lead a ſub-diviſion of <hi>Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</hi> In the <hi>Van-guard</hi> next to him in honour in this <hi>diviſion,</hi> is the ſeventh <hi>Captain,</hi> who is appointed to bring up the firſt grand <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which likewiſe is more honour unto him, then to lead or bring up any ſub-diviſion of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> as before expreſſed. Having thus reſolved of all the <hi>Captains,</hi> and <hi>Captains Lieutenants</hi> place, next follows the reaſons of the <hi>Lieutenants</hi> places, where firſt take notice that the eldeſt <hi>Captains Lieutenant</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to bring up the <hi>Reer-guard,</hi> which next the <hi>Pikes</hi> is the greateſt place of honour in the <hi>Reer,</hi> and a very honourable place unto him; or if he alters places with the third <hi>Captain</hi> upon the <hi>long-march,</hi> yet nevertheleſſe he hath the chiefeſt place of honour after the <hi>Captain Lieutenant</hi> amongſt all the <hi>Lieutenants</hi> unto thoſe places he is ordered unto. The third <hi>Captains Lieutenant</hi> is aſſigned to the next place, who leads the ſecond <hi>diviſion</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers</hi> in the <hi>Van-guard,</hi> which is more honour to him then to bring up any ſuch <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion;</hi> after follows him the fourth <hi>Captains Lieutenant,</hi> who brings up the <hi>Reer</hi> of the <hi>Van-guard,</hi> which is more honour to him, of the places remaining to be there, then to bring up either the firſt <hi>diviſion</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> or the firſt <hi>diviſion</hi> of <hi>Pikes.</hi> Laſtly, the ſeventh <hi>Captains Lieutenant</hi> is placed to bring up the firſt <hi>diviſion</hi> of <hi>Pikes,</hi> which being the more honourable <hi>Arms,</hi> it adds more honour to him to be there to bring up, then the firſt <hi>diviſion</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> which being the laſt place of honour, it is given to the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lieutenants Bringer-up</hi> to be there; and thus much ſhall ſuffice for the reaſons of the places of the firſt grand <hi>Diviſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for placing of the Officers of the ſecond grand <hi>Diviſion,</hi> I ſhall not need to ſpeak any thing concerning the <hi>Lieutenant Collonels Major,</hi> Second <hi>Captain,</hi> and the <hi>Majors Lieutenants</hi> place, in regard in the former <hi>Regiments</hi> I have endevoured to give the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſatisfaction therein.

                  <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>The manner both of the drawing up, and the order of the</hi> Long-march <hi>of Collonel</hi> Rainsborough <hi>his Regiment, bringing up the</hi> Reer <hi>of the foot of the</hi> Army, <hi>under the Command of the Lord Generall</hi> Fairfax, <hi>at their firſt marching through the City of</hi> London, <hi>on the ſeventh of</hi> Auguſt, 1647.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt order of drawing up the <hi>Regiment</hi> at their firſt place of <hi>Randezvous,</hi> before they marched or joyn'd with the <hi>Army</hi> was thus; The <hi>Collonels Company</hi> being upon the out-moſt part of the right of the <hi>Regiment,</hi> next to his left by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was drawn up the ſecond, ſixt, fift, and firſt <hi>Captains,</hi> which make up his <hi>diviſion,</hi> or the right <hi>half-ranks</hi> in their firſt drawing up to be compleat, and may in their figure of <hi>dignity</hi> ſtanding in a <hi>rank</hi> be demonſtrated as followeth, 4: 8: 9: 5: 1. This number of <hi>worth</hi> being caſt up amounteth to 27, and thus much for the <hi>Collonels Diviſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the left <hi>half-ranks,</hi> or <hi>Lieutenant Collonels Diviſion,</hi> (as many times it is ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and appointed) his own <hi>Company</hi> being drawn up upon the out-moſt part on the left of the <hi>Regiment,</hi> and next to his right after each other is drawn up the third, ſeventh, fourth, and <hi>Majors Company,</hi> whoſe <hi>figure</hi> of <hi>dignity</hi> ſtanding <hi>rank-wiſe,</hi> may be thus deſcribed, 2: 6: 10: 7: 3. and their number of <hi>dignity</hi> in all amounteth to 28. Where you may perceive a rule that the diſcretion of the <hi>Major</hi> walketh by, in the drawing up of the <hi>Regiment,</hi> to <hi>ballance</hi> with as neer proportion as he can the <hi>number, worth,</hi> and <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of his right <hi>half-ranks,</hi> or right <hi>flank,</hi> ſutable with that of the left.

                  <p>The <hi>Captains</hi> now ſtanding by their own <hi>colours,</hi> on the head of the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and their Companies being drawn up all, and ſtanding in an even <hi>Front,</hi> the <hi>Major</hi> next commands the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> to ſtand, the <hi>Pikes</hi> and <hi>Colours</hi> to troop forth ſome ten or twelve paces cleer of the <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and then they likewiſe to ſtand, and after to cloſe their <hi>files</hi> to the midſt to order.</p>
                  <p>Next he commands the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> in their <hi>files</hi> to cloſe outward to order, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them afterward to move up, and <hi>flank</hi> the <hi>Pikes,</hi> after which he orders the Body into thirteen remarkable <hi>diviſions,</hi> four <hi>diviſions</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers</hi> upon each ſide of the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and the <hi>Pikes</hi> into five <hi>diviſions,</hi> having their <hi>colours flye</hi> by two and two, and to be led by thoſe <hi>Enſign-bearers</hi> that do belong to each of them, excepting the firſt and middle divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for they have Leaders in chief, as the firſt and fift <hi>Captain,</hi> and the third <hi>Captain,</hi> to bring up the <hi>Reer</hi> of the whole Body of <hi>Pikes.</hi> For more fuller illuſtration of the leading and bringing up of each diviſion, in the <hi>Regiment</hi> upon their <hi>Long-march,</hi> obſerve theſe following directions.</p>

                  <p>Here you may perceive they follow a rule to <hi>ballance</hi> their number of <hi>dignity</hi> as neer as they can, carrying their odd number on the left <hi>half-rank,</hi> and not upon the right, for theſe reaſons, as, I conceive, following. Their <hi>Regiments</hi> being ſo full of men, they draw them up for the moſt part into three <hi>Squadrons,</hi> or grand <hi>Diviſions,</hi> giving unto the <hi>Lieutenant Collonel</hi> the right <hi>wing,</hi> the <hi>Major</hi> the left, and the <hi>Collonel,</hi> the <hi>Main-battail.</hi> The <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels</hi> grand Diviſion conſiſts of the four middle Companies, where you are to take notice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn off ſome ten paces cleer from the reſt, they ſtand after this manner by way of figure 4: 7: 9: 1. The <hi>Leiutenant Collonels</hi> Diviſion after this manner, 5: 10: 2. and the <hi>Majors</hi> after this kind, 6: 8: 3. Wherein I do obſerve in each grand Diviſion this rule, that by ſucceſſion and degrees they put the beſt Souldiers upon the right, and the ſecond according to courſe upon the left, and the reſt between them. As firſt, the <hi>Collonel</hi> being the chiefeſt man of honour is placed upon the right of his <hi>Squadron,</hi> next to his left is the ſixt and fourth <hi>Captain,</hi> and the cloſing up of his grand Diviſion, is placed the firſt or eldeſt <hi>Captain.</hi> The <hi>Leiutenant Collonel</hi> being the ſecond man of honour is likewiſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon the right of his <hi>Squadron,</hi> and next to his left the ſeventh <hi>Captain,</hi> his grand Diviſion being cloſed up by the ſecond <hi>Captain.</hi> In the next place, the <hi>Major,</hi> he being the third man of honour, is placed upon the right of his <hi>Squadron,</hi> and upon his left, the fift <hi>Captain,</hi> and his grand Diviſion is cloſed up upon the left by the third <hi>Captain.</hi> So that you may obſerve in the cloſing up of every Diviſion, that as every Field-Officer is upon the right of their <hi>Squadrons,</hi> ſo they take by degrees upon the out-moſt of their left to cloſe their Diviſions, the <hi>Captains</hi> according to their degrees by ſucceſſion. As firſt, and more cleerly, the <hi>Collonel</hi> takes the eldeſt <hi>Captain</hi> to him on his left, who will aptly fall in to lead his Body of <hi>pikes,</hi> and <hi>colours;</hi> the <hi>Lieutenant Collonel</hi> takes the ſecond <hi>Captain,</hi> for to lead his Stand of <hi>pikes</hi> and <hi>colours;</hi> the third <hi>Captain</hi> being placed upon the left of the out-moſt part of the <hi>Majors Squadron,</hi> to lead likewiſe his <hi>colours,</hi> and Body of <hi>pikes.</hi> And further if you obſerve the number of <hi>worth,</hi> and <hi>dignity,</hi> that the right <hi>wing</hi> hath with the left, you will finde them to be equally ballanced, and to be 17 a like in number. Now in reſpect there cannot be an equall Diviſion of the <hi>colours</hi> by threes, there is very good reaſon that the odd ſhould be placed in the <hi>Collonels Squadron,</hi> who is Commander in chiefe, and to whom it properly belongs unto.</p>

                  <p>But before the former figure be drawn up, it will be convenient for the <hi>Major</hi> to take off from every Company four <hi>files</hi> of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> (excepting the <hi>Collonels)</hi> and move them down by 12 <hi>files</hi> a piece ſome ten foot cleer of the <hi>Reer</hi> of <hi>Pikes</hi> of each <hi>diviſion,</hi> and then cloſe them in their <hi>files</hi> inward to <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>face</hi> them after to the <hi>Front,</hi> and they will ſtand there ready upon all occaſions to be <hi>Reſerves</hi> unto the <hi>Wings,</hi> or any other part of the Body, or to be <hi>Convoys</hi> to fetch in <hi>Victuall, Ammunition,</hi> or any thing elſe that ſhall be wanting unto the <hi>Regiment.</hi> I ſhall not need to draw any other <hi>Figure</hi> of <hi>Battail</hi> from this, they ſtanding in a very good form to <hi>fire</hi> upon, opening every five <hi>files</hi> cleer from each other ſix foot that the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> may have room enough, to fall off, and to move down in the <hi>Reer</hi> of themſelves, after ſuch time their <hi>ranks</hi> have <hi>fired.</hi> Neither ſhall I need to give any further reaſons for the placing of the Officers, in reſpect it lyes cleer and eaſie to the view of every ingenuous Souldier to apprehend. As for matter of <hi>marching,</hi> if they have ground ſufficient, it will be very gracefull to them for to preſerve this figure; but if they have not room, but muſt be conſtrain'd to draw off, and <hi>march</hi> in perticuler <hi>diviſions</hi> it will be convenient to keep this <hi>decorum,</hi> if the <hi>Collonel</hi> thinks fit to change places every day, after this manner. He that leads the <hi>Van-guard</hi> one day, falls off the next, and bring up the <hi>Reer-ward;</hi> and he that before led the <hi>Main-battail,</hi> comes to lead the <hi>Van,</hi> and he that led the <hi>Reer-ward,</hi> comes to be in the place of the <hi>Main-battail.</hi> And thus they change, and take their turns by courſe, to lead the <hi>Van,</hi> the <hi>Battail,</hi> and the <hi>Reer-ward.</hi> They ought likewiſe in their <hi>March</hi> to have thirty foot of ground diſtance betwixt each grand <hi>Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and when they have ground ſufficient, they may draw up again into their firſt figure. Now in reſpect I purpoſe to go on upon the next drawing up of a <hi>Regiment</hi> of 12 Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I ſhall break off to diſcourſe any more of this. For the reducing of them again into Companies, it will be eaſie, let the <hi>Serjeants</hi> of each perticuler Company fetch off thoſe men of theirs which were drawn off for <hi>Reſerves,</hi> and to make the <hi>Squadrons</hi> even in number, bring them to joyn with their own men; then let every <hi>Captain</hi> take off his <hi>Pikes</hi> and <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and compleat them up into one Body, they will be ready to receive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to be in a condition for <hi>marching</hi> away, either to their <hi>Quarters,</hi> or other duties, which they ſhall be appointed unto by their <hi>Major.</hi>

                  <p>In the next place, for a <hi>Brigade,</hi> I ſhall point forth four <hi>Regiments,</hi> having in them eight <hi>Companies</hi> a piece, after the manner of a <hi>Regiment</hi> of eight formerly ſet down, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to 3888 men, which number may ſerve for a third part of an Army of foot, and make up a very compleat and ſufficient <hi>Brigade.</hi> And I ſhall order in this <hi>Brigade</hi> to have in it four <hi>diviſions,</hi> that is to ſay, a <hi>Van-guard, Battail,</hi> and <hi>Reer-guard,</hi> repreſented in the three firſt <hi>Regiments,</hi> but the fourth ſhall be a <hi>reſerve,</hi> ſtanding in the <hi>Reer</hi> of the <hi>Main-battail,</hi> or <hi>Brigade,</hi> whereby upon all occaſions of the other retreating, or being driven backward that <hi>Regiment</hi> may move up to relieve each part thereof that ſhall be diſtreſſed.

                  <p>THe drawing up of an <hi>Army</hi> moſt properly belongs to the <hi>Serjeant Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> whoſe place and charge is of an high degree, his commands being full of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therefore ought to be a wiſe, grave, and able perſon, and an able an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Souldier. In reſpect he hath the ordering and diſpoſing of the <hi>Diviſions</hi> and <hi>Battalions,</hi> according to that forme which the <hi>Generall</hi> ſhall command him. And upon all occaſions he muſt be active, and ſtirring up and down, to ſpie out all advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which might offend an Enemy; and wiſely to fore-ſee all diſadvantages that may bring the <hi>Troops</hi> into any diſorder or confuſion. He hath abſolute command over the three <hi>Serjeant Majors</hi> of the <hi>Brigades,</hi> otherwiſe called the three <hi>Grand Corporals</hi> of the Field, who are to be his aſſiſtants, and his mouth, as he is the mouth of the <hi>Lord Generall,</hi> or <hi>Martiall</hi> of the Field; and therefore muſt have a vigilant eye over all things, ſeeing that the <hi>Generals</hi> Command delivered to him be ſtrictly kept, and obſerved, and withall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting, and informing the three <hi>Serjeant Majors</hi> of the <hi>Brigades</hi> of the <hi>Generals</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that they may forthwith put the ſame into execution.</p>
                  <p>Now the Method (that I ſhall obſerve,) ſhall be according to the forme of the former <hi>Brigade;</hi> wherefore, in the firſt place, the <hi>Serjeant Major</hi> ſhall do well to appoint out unto the eldeſt <hi>Serjeant Major</hi> of the <hi>Brigades,</hi> how to draw up that <hi>Brigade</hi> which ſhall be the <hi>Battail,</hi> wherein the <hi>Lord Generals Regiment,</hi> and the <hi>Collonels,</hi> is to be upon the right, and left of that <hi>Brigade,</hi> and betwixt them the youngeſt <hi>Collonel,</hi> and ninth <hi>Collonel,</hi> according unto this rule of <hi>dignity</hi> in the figure ſet forth, 4: 9: 12: 1. In the next place, let the next <hi>Serjeant Major</hi> of the <hi>Brigades</hi> in ſeniority draw up that which ſhall be the <hi>Van-guard,</hi> and place the ſecond <hi>Collonels Regiment</hi> upon the right, and the fifth upon the left, and between them the eleventh and eighth <hi>Collonels,</hi> after this manner, of this figure, 5: 8 11: 2. Let the laſt <hi>Serjeant Major</hi> draw up that <hi>Brigade,</hi> which ſhall be the <hi>Reer,</hi> and let him draw them up after this manner, the third <hi>Collonels Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon the right, and upon the left, the ſixth <hi>Collonels,</hi> and between them the tenth, and ſeventh <hi>Collonels Regiment,</hi> after this manner, 6: 7: 10: 3.

In the next place, for the better expedition in drawing up the Army, every <hi>Serjeant Major</hi> of each <hi>Brigade</hi> draws the former <hi>Regiments</hi> aſſign'd unto them, unto ſuch place as ſhall be appointed forth unto them by the <hi>Serjeant Major Generall,</hi> being helped, and aſſiſted by the Field-officers of the ſame <hi>Regiments,</hi> the <hi>Serjeant Major Generall</hi> likewiſe being an aſſiſtant unto them all, ſeeing thereby all the Commands of the <hi>Generall</hi> rightly obſerved and fulfilled.</p>

                  <p>After this the <hi>Generall</hi> of the <hi>Ordance</hi> his duty and care muſt be in the day of <hi>battail,</hi> to ſee that the <hi>Ordnance</hi> be well placed; for at ſuch time his wiſdome is moſt diſcern'd, keeping (with the aſſiſtance of his <hi>Lieutenant)</hi> the <hi>Tram</hi> of <hi>Artillery</hi> together in good order. He muſt have a vigilant eye upon all accidents that may fall out, and make choiſe of ſuch ground for their planting, as the <hi>Generall</hi> of the <hi>Army,</hi> and he ſhall think moſt fit and convenient. He muſt be carefull that all things be in a readineſſe, putting the <hi>Maſter Gunners, Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Ordnance,</hi> and Commanders in minde of their duty, that they do their beſt endeavours, and acquit themſelves like men. It is likewiſe partly his charge, to ſee that the whole Army be well provided with <hi>Ammunition,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Ammunition</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under his <hi>Train.</hi> He muſt alſo be neer the <hi>Gen.</hi> of the Army upon all occaſious, to receive his directions and commands, and to know from him after what manner he will make his <hi>battail,</hi> that he may plant his <hi>Ordnance</hi> accordingly, finding out <hi>hills</hi> and <hi>heights</hi> to <hi>play</hi> over his own men. And when the Enemy ſhall preſent himſelfe, and come up to charge, he muſt draw, and <hi>plant</hi> his <hi>Ordnance,</hi> as neer their <hi>horſe</hi> as poſſible may be, to hinder them from breaking in upon the <hi>diviſions</hi> of <hi>foot,</hi> taking a long with him <hi>Saylours,</hi> and <hi>Pioneers,</hi> to help to draw up the <hi>Ordnance,</hi> and ſufficient <hi>Guards</hi> to defend them.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the planting of the <hi>Ordnance,</hi> when the <hi>Battalia</hi> is drawn up, they may be diſpoſed off ſeverall ways; as ſomtimes they are placed upon the head of the <hi>Battalia,</hi> others again, between them, by two and two, and others, by threes, upon the <hi>flanks</hi> and <hi>wings</hi> of the <hi>Muskettiers.</hi> Some are of opinion, that they ought to be planted upon the <hi>flanks,</hi> and in the <hi>Reer</hi> of the <hi>Battalia,</hi> by leaving a free place for Armes which may give no offence to their own men. But as concerning this laſt way, it might be anſwered, it can no way be expedient; for if an Enemy ſhould perceive that the <hi>Front</hi> is left bare without <hi>Ordnance,</hi> it will give them cauſe to come up with more courage to fall on upon the Charge. Therefore, the beſt way amongſt the ancient experienc'd Souldiers, is, that the <hi>Artillery</hi> be divided, ſome here, ſome there, both before the <hi>Front,</hi> between the <hi>Battalions,</hi> and upon the <hi>Flanks,</hi> and to be placed ſome 50 or an 100 paces one from another, and then there will be no danger when the Enemy ſhall come up to <hi>ſhock</hi> to encounter you, or to offend our own men. Eſpecially, when they are faſtened to them by drawing <hi>ropes,</hi> and <hi>iron rings,</hi> that upon an inſtant they may be removed, and turn'd for the advantage of our own <hi>Troops,</hi> giving <hi>fire,</hi> as faſt as they can charge and diſcharge againſt the Enemies <hi>Troops,</hi> it being a matter of great moment for the obteining of a victory, and gaining the day from the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>But that many times the <hi>Ordnance</hi> cannot be planted in ſuch convenient places as could be wiſhed for, in reſpect an Army may be driven into ſuch places, as the <hi>Ordnance</hi> muſt be planted according to the beſt ground it will afford, by reaſon of <hi>woods, hills,</hi> or <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh grounds,</hi> and ſuch like diſadvantageous places, may be oftentimes met withall, for which no certain rule may be given, but that the <hi>Generall</hi> by his wiſdom and diſcretion may make choice of the beſt advantages which might annoy an Enemy moſt, and give the leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to his own men, either by dazling them by the <hi>Sun,</hi> or by raiſing of the <hi>duſt,</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>winde</hi> which drives the <hi>ſmoak</hi> both of the <hi>Ordnance</hi> and <hi>ſmall-ſhot</hi> full upon them. To conclude, it is conceived, the beſt way for every <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Ordnance,</hi> and <hi>Maſter Gunner</hi> to uſe ſome light <hi>Field peeces</hi> and ſmall <hi>Drakes,</hi> which upon any occaſion may be removed from one place to another, being with eaſe planted upon ſuch places of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage as may moſt annoy the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, 3000 <hi>horſe</hi> may be a good proportion for 10000 or 12000 <hi>foot,</hi> which ought to be equally divided in their <hi>Troops,</hi> and placed upon the <hi>flanks</hi> of the <hi>foot</hi> in ſuch good order, as the <hi>Troops</hi> may come with conveniency to fight, for the relieving of each other. But in caſe you ſhall perceive the Enemies <hi>horſe,</hi> as ſomtimes through ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ground, or by other politicall ends, may be inter-laced and placed between

                     <p>A Sentinel muſt be very vigilant, carefully caſting his eyes about him, and harkning whether he heare the noyſe or approach of any drawing neer him; which if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, he is preſently to command them to ſtand, preſenting his Musket or Pike to their breſt, and after calling his Corporal for to take the word, unleſſe he ſhould be commanded to come in ſilently.

Or it may be a very proper poſture for a pikeman to ſtand ſentinell with his pike in his left hand, holding it a little below the cheeks thereof, and with his ſword drawn, being held in his right hand, which I leave to judge, or to be made uſe of according to diſcretion, and as occaſion ſhall require.</p>

                     <p>A Gentleman of a company ought to have ſuch worth in him as may make him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be a file-leader, or Captain of his file, and he more eſpecially above the reſt ought to be well skill'd in all the poſtures of ſuch armes he weares, and at convenient times inſtructing and teaching his file in the neat and gracefull handling of their armes. He ought to be of an undaunted courage and gallant reſolution, for the better example and imitation of the reſt, whoſe worth and valour many times indears them ſo much into the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their Comanders that they raiſe them up to greater places of preferment. In the Low Countries a Gentleman of a Company hath his full pay, having nothing kept back for after reckonings, as common private ſouldiers have. At his firſt entrance he ſomtimes ſtands Sentinell to informe himſelfe of the duties thereof; but moſt commonly he is placed to be a Sentinell per-due intime of iminent danger, either in the field or upon approches. He is to lie perdue with his ſword and piſtoll, not removing from his place till he be relieved, nor is he to retreat for one man, but in caſe of more, then he is to fall back to the ſecond; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering an enemy he is to come off betimes, and ſilently to give the alarum, whereby the Corps du Guard, or company may be provided for their own defence. A Gentleman of a Company doth many times goe the round with the Captain of the watch, or his fellow Gentlemen who are likewiſe rounders, either in the field, or in garriſon, and doe give the Corporals of the Guards the word, charging the Sentinells to looke well about them. To conclude, he ought truly to love, reſpect, and obey his Captain, and to ſtick cloſe unto him, vindicating him upon all juſt occaſions, when he ſhall be wronged, and injured by any mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

His care muſt be to execute juſtice, appeaſe quarrels, puniſh offendors; by doing whereof, he will maintain the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of his place. He ought to carry a very even hand over his Souldiers, and to be very courteous, and kind unto them, yet with that reſtriction of familiarity that he come not under contempt.

For the finding out of the fitteſt and ableſt perſons for this employment, it is moſt eſpecially the duty of the <hi>Wagon Maſters,</hi> who are to ſee and enquire certainly, that they be men known and practiſed in all paſſable <hi>By-paths, Croſſe-ways, &amp;c.</hi> That they be able to give an accompt of the diſtance of places, of the evenneſſe, and ſtreightneſſe of them, whether they be plain, or crooked, hilly, or ſtony, and difficult for paſſage; what <hi>Rivers, Hedges, Ditches,</hi> and <hi>Bridges,</hi> lye in the way, and which way (if there ſhall be ſeverall ways) is the ſafeſt and ſhorteſt, which the neerer or farther, to, or from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <hi>Quarters,</hi> which more probable for their approaches, as likewiſe for <hi>Quarter,</hi> what <hi>Forrage,</hi> what <hi>Water</hi> is to be had, and how convenient the way is for <hi>Baggage.</hi> If it ſhall happen that theſe <hi>Guides</hi> may be choſen partly out of the Souldiers, and partly from the Countrey-men, and ſo any ſcruple, jar, or difference happen in opinion, ſuch <hi>Officers,</hi> and others as are beſt skill'd in thoſe parts and places, are either to reconcile the difference, or from the moſt probable intelligence, to conclude upon the moſt convenient paſſages. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the danger and great hazards, if not utter ruine, that the <hi>Guides</hi> ſomtimes do, and often may draw the Souldiers into, by treachery and falſe play, they are many times cauſed to ride halter'd about the neck, to put them in mind of capitall puniſhment, if they ſhall
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40901:118"/> miſlead the Party they guide, but in caſe they diſcharge their truſt faithfully, and ably, they ought to be as well rewarded for the encouragement, as otherwiſe to be puniſhed for the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of others.</p>

                     <p>AN active Enemy is always watchfull, and diligent to apprehend every opportunity that may make for his advantage, and therefore it concerns every <hi>Commander</hi> by way of <hi>Counter-mine,</hi> as it were, to be carefull, that he rightly and fully informe himſelfe of their ways and courſes, for prevention of his own danger, in caſe of ſuddain aſſaults, and the better infeſting of his Enemy.

And he that will make choiſe of able and truſty men in this kind, muſt, after diligent obſervation, and weighing of their diſpoſitions and courage, ſelect them out of his own Souldiers, who under pretence of ſome diſcontent for want of pay, &amp;c. may thereby with leſſe ſuſpition receive entertainment from the Enemy, and (if it be poſſible) to be liſted with the <hi>Horſe,</hi> whereby they may gain the fairer Opportunities in <hi>Field,</hi> or <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,</hi> to give certain intelligence of all <hi>Deſignes</hi> and <hi>Occurrences</hi> in the Enemies <hi>Quarters.</hi>

                     <p>Before their departure from you, let them take their ſeverall inſtructions (for the more you have the better, ſo that that they be deſign'd for ſeverall places, and unknown unto each other) both for times, and places of conveyance, which places muſt be ſtrictly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and duly ſearched for ſuch informations, as your <hi>Spies</hi> ſhall convey thither, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let your anſwers, and adviſes be re-conveyed for their further inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes there may ariſe matters of ſuch importance and conſequence, that it will not only be convenient to certifie by letter, but moſt neceſſary to make appearance in perſon, and there to conſult and adviſe together, if perhaps the Enemy ſhall be reſolved to fall upon ſome of the oppoſite <hi>Quarters</hi> ſuddainly, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXIV. <hi>Of</hi> Military Watches.</head>
                  <p>HOw neceſſary theſe <hi>Watches</hi> are in all <hi>Armies</hi> is evident to all men; the grand and chiefeſt care whereof, for order and direction, reſteth in the <hi>Serjeant Major,</hi> who iſſueth out ſuch precepts therein to the <hi>Captains,</hi> or <hi>Companies,</hi> as he himſelfe before received from his ſuperiour <hi>Officer,</hi> and according to the ſaid precepts received, whether it be in <hi>Garriſon</hi> or <hi>Field,</hi> the work and duty required, is to be performed either by <hi>Squadrons,</hi> or full <hi>Companies,</hi> having reſpect unto the ſtrength or weakneſſe of the Place to be guarded, and in ſuch places as are moſt likely for the Enemy to make his approaches in, and that there they be carefull to fortifie the <hi>Guard</hi> above other places of leſſe concernment; which muſt be obſerved by the <hi>Major,</hi> in ſurveying the <hi>Guards,</hi> and <hi>Guard Places,</hi> in his walking of the grand <hi>Round,</hi> and ſo, according as his diſcretion ſhall ſee fit, to take from the ſtronger places of <hi>Guard</hi> ſuch Souldiers as may ſupply the defects of the weaker.</p>
                  <p>The appointmtment of perticuler <hi>Guards</hi> unto perticuler <hi>Captains,</hi> is in the power of the <hi>Major,</hi> or otherwiſe, He commandeth the <hi>Serjeant</hi> of each <hi>Company</hi> to attend him at his <hi>Quarter,</hi> at any certain houre of the day as he ſhall think fit, where every one is to do duty upon the <hi>Guard</hi> that night, taketh his lot in order, (which lots are ſhuffled together in an Hat) which directeth him upon what <hi>Guard</hi> to attend that night. This being done, all the <hi>Serjeants</hi> that have their direction for the duty of the <hi>Guard,</hi> are to make a <hi>Ring,</hi> or <hi>Circle,</hi> according to their degrees in Seniority. To the Senior of all which <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>Serjeants,</hi> the <hi>Major</hi> giveth the <hi>word</hi> privately in his eare, who after the ſame manner paſſeth it to the next, and ſo from Man to Man unto the youngeſt, who whiſpers it in the ear of his <hi>Major;</hi> who ſends it back again in the former manner for Securities ſake, untill it come to the <hi>Senior Serjeant</hi> again, who then leaves it in the care of his <hi>Major,</hi> which preventeth all miſtakes for each perticuler <hi>Company.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Guards</hi> being thus ſet in order, the <hi>Officers</hi> relieved ought to informe the <hi>Officers</hi> of the Relievers, of all the ſeverall duties of their ſeverall <hi>Guards, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every <hi>Commander</hi> in Chief of that perticuler <hi>Squadron,</hi> which he is appointed unto, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up his own <hi>Squadron</hi> from the <hi>Parade</hi> to their appointed <hi>Guard,</hi> to which, when they approach, the <hi>Officer</hi> in Chief delivers the <hi>word</hi> to the <hi>Corporall</hi> or his <hi>Lance-prizadoe,</hi> and they to their Superiour <hi>Officers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The manner of relieving is by planting a <hi>Guard</hi> of <hi>Pikes</hi> next to the <hi>Relievers,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to them in the <hi>Reer</hi> a Guard of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> through whom the <hi>Relievers</hi> are to paſſe, and the <hi>Relieved</hi> to march back to their <hi>Quarters.</hi> After all things thus ſet in order, the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Guard</hi> in perſon, by ſtrict injunction commandeth every man to his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from which no man either <hi>Officer</hi> or other is to depart without an eſpeciall Licenſe, and in all <hi>Alarms</hi> to ſtand cloſe, and quietly to their <hi>Arms,</hi> expecting further inſtruction and command what they are to do. And all this time, and conſtantly a <hi>Sentinell</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to guard the Eutrance into the <hi>Main-Guard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every Officer and Souldier in a <hi>Regiment,</hi> is worthy of Honour, Pay, and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to his Merrit and Seniority; and to this end, there ought to be a perfect Liſt of the names and number of all perticuler Souldiers and Officers in every <hi>Squadron,</hi> which Liſt or Catalogue is to remain in the hands of the ſeverall <hi>Corporals,</hi> or <hi>Lance-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zadoes,</hi> which <hi>Corporals</hi> are diligently to ſee what defects there are of all ſeverall neceſſaries in then <hi>Corps</hi> du <hi>Guard,</hi> and to be carefull that they be continually ſupplied; which he muſt do, by information to his <hi>Major,</hi> and (in caſe of his abſence or neglect) to his <hi>Captain,</hi> who may informe the Governour, that all wants of <hi>Fire, Ammunition,</hi> or <hi>Lights</hi> be made good, and compleated.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Corporals</hi> according to order and precept given to them, are to diſpoſe of the ſeverall <hi>Sentinels,</hi> as well <hi>Pikes</hi> as <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and to have an eſpeciall care, that they keep their <hi>Muskets prim'd</hi> and <hi>laden,</hi> and their <hi>Match cockt</hi> and <hi>lighted,</hi> with their <hi>Pan</hi> guarded, which muſt be obſerved by their often viſiting the ſeverall <hi>Sentinels,</hi> to ſee that all things be in due order, and with ſilence, to the end that the <hi>Sentinels</hi> may always be heard, as often as occaſion is offered.</p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:40901:119"/>
                  <p>The Office of every <hi>Sentinell</hi> after he is placed upon his duty, and in his due <hi>Peſture,</hi> (according as is above declared) is to enquire of every paſſenger, or other that ſhall but ſtir, who goes there? yea, though it be the <hi>Captain</hi> himſelfe, and howſoever the remoteſt <hi>Sentinell</hi> from the <hi>Corps</hi> du <hi>Guard,</hi> is to permit him with his <hi>Retinue</hi> to paſſe; yet he is bound to have an eye upon them, till he approach the neereſt <hi>Sentinell</hi> to the <hi>Corps,</hi> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like demand, is anſwered. The <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Watch,</hi> which latter <hi>Sentinell</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to ſtand, and thereupon with a loud voice calls forth his <hi>Corporall,</hi> the <hi>Sentinell</hi> not ſtirring from his place, or <hi>Poſture,</hi> untill the <hi>Corporall</hi> with his Sword drawn ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with a Guard of <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> who are to be all arm'd, and appointed as the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels</hi> ready to preſent; whereupon the <hi>Corporall</hi> with one only <hi>Muskettier</hi> advancing, and perceiving him to be the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Watch</hi> indeed, is to give him the <hi>word</hi> in his eare, having reſpectively firſt caſt down the point of his Sword, afterward receiving fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtructions from him, he conducts him to his fartheſt <hi>Sentinell.</hi> But if it ſhall appear that he be not the <hi>Captain,</hi> or the <hi>Corporall</hi> knowing him not juſtly to be ſo, by a juſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, He may then detein him (although he ſhall give him the <hi>word)</hi> and then he ſhall further demand the <hi>word</hi> of ſome other attending him, from whom having received it, he may more ſafely permit them to paſſe; but of all others whatſoever ſhall attempt a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage he is to receive the <hi>word</hi> from them, and not to deliver it to them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Captain</hi> himſelfe having done the duty in perſon of paſſing the firſt <hi>Round,</hi> upon his return, he is to ſend forth others upon the like duty, ſuch as he ſhall out of his diſcretion chooſe from his <hi>Main-Guard,</hi> and may moſt confide in, to whom he is to impart the <hi>word</hi> at their ſetting forth upon the duty, and not before, with ſtrict admonitions, and full inſtructions what they are to do, and what way to take.</p>
                  <p>Now if he ſhall be ſupplyed with men enough upon his own <hi>Guard,</hi> he may at the ſame time command out ſeverall <hi>Rounders</hi> to be taken ſeverall ways; who are diligently to obſerve their directions given them, and to be very vigilant in the obſervation of all things in their paſſage, both by the eye and the eare, and to admoniſh the <hi>Sentinels</hi> (in caſe of neglect) that all things be more carefully lookt unto in their duty. And of theſe <hi>Rounders</hi> likewiſe (as before) the fore-moſt <hi>Sentinell</hi> demands, <hi>Who goes there?</hi> When being anſwered ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily, as by the name of the <hi>Round,</hi> or <hi>Friends,</hi> he permits them paſſage to the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Sentinell,</hi> who having ſtopt them there takes a further accompt, what, and who they are. Which is done by calling forth his <hi>Corporall,</hi> who placing the point of his Sword at one of their breſts, takes the <hi>word</hi> privately, and ſo paſſes them by conduct to the furtheſt <hi>Sentinell.</hi> But if there ſhall happen a miſtake in the <hi>word,</hi> the <hi>Corporall</hi> is either to ſecure them with himſelfe, or by <hi>Guard</hi> to transferre them to the <hi>Main-Guard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such as ſhall walk the <hi>Round,</hi> are to take a ſtrict accompt of all they meet, what, and who they are, and in caſe of deficiency, of anſwering juſtly on the one ſide, or ſuſpition of the other; they are to ſecure and guard them to the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Watch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſetting a ſide thoſe <hi>Queries</hi> which ſome do make between <hi>Rounders</hi> and <hi>Counter-Rounders,</hi> if they meet, who ſhall give or take the <hi>word;</hi> the beſt and ſafeſt courſe is, for them all that before the <hi>word</hi> be either given or taken, they go together to the neereſt <hi>Corps</hi> du <hi>Guard,</hi> and there to give the <hi>word,</hi> after which they are to paſſe upon their duty again; and ſo having finiſhed the <hi>Round,</hi> and returning to the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Watch,</hi> he taketh acompt of them of all things that they have done and obſerved in their duty and courſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Round,</hi> and thus the <hi>Captain</hi> ſtill ſupplies the <hi>Rounds</hi> ſucceſſively by ſuch others as he ſhall take by ſeniority and diſpoſe off for the like ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, that all diſorders, irregularities, and ſuch perſons as ſhall cauſe the ſame in a <hi>Town</hi> of <hi>Garriſon,</hi> may be found out and rectified, and that all dangerous accidents by fire, or other wiſe may be prevented; the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Watch</hi> commandeth out a <hi>Guard</hi> of <hi>Fire-locks,</hi> or <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> to view the <hi>Streets,</hi> and all ſuſpitious and irregular perſons as they take, they are to bring to the <hi>Main-Guard</hi> of this <hi>Guard,</hi> which is always conducted by a <hi>Serjeant,</hi> and is called the <hi>Patroville,</hi> happen to be <hi>Muskettiers,</hi> and not <hi>Fire-locks,</hi> then they are to be every one provided of ſuch an inſtrument as may cover the lighted <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> and keep them from diſcovery. From theſe alſo, as from the <hi>Rounders,</hi> the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Watch</hi> takes full accompt of all their paſſages and obſervations on their duty.</p>
                  <p>When at any time any ſuddain approach ſhall be made, or any Enemy diſcovered, the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40901:119"/> 
                     <hi>Sentinell</hi> (who is to be firm and conſtant to his <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Poſture,</hi> till he ſhall be relieved) forthwith by <hi>firing</hi> gives the <hi>Alarm,</hi> and immediately ſeconds it by crying with a loud voice, <hi>Arme, Arme.</hi> When the <hi>Alarm</hi> is thus given, the other two <hi>diviſions</hi> immediately led by their <hi>Officers,</hi> are orderly to march up to the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Main-Guard,</hi> to the intent, that all <hi>Guards</hi> of the <hi>Garriſon</hi> may with expedition be made good, and it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that theſe inſtructions be given them indeed by the <hi>Serjeant Major,</hi> when he ſhall give the <hi>word</hi> to the <hi>Minor Serjeants,</hi> who muſt likewiſe informe their chiefe <hi>Officers</hi> of it, and from them the Souldiers are to be charged and acquainted therewith, that ſo upon all occaſions they may not be ignorant of this part of their duty, but ready to perform it.</p>
                  <p>The duty of a <hi>Sentinell,</hi> is to ſtand in his <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Poſture,</hi> a full houre, and no more, at which time the <hi>Corporall</hi> or (in caſe of his abſence) his <hi>Lanſ-pazadoe</hi> is to relieve him, and not only him, but all the <hi>Sentinels</hi> that are out upon duty, relieving the fartheſt <hi>Sentinell</hi> firſt (who falls in the <hi>Reer</hi> of the reſt) and ſo all the others backward in the like order, and then conducts the relieved <hi>Sentinels</hi> back to the <hi>Guard</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>At an early hour of the morning appointed for beating up the <hi>Revally,</hi> the two <hi>Sentinels</hi> next unto the <hi>Guard</hi> are to retreat into it.</p>
                  <p>At the time appointed, in the morning for opening of the Gates, the <hi>Serjeant Major</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a ſufficient Guard, repaires to the Governour, or place elſwhere allotted, and there, receives the <hi>Keys,</hi> which being done, he is to unlock firſt that Gate which is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from danger of the Enemy, and the reſt in order anſwerable, but if it happen to be in place and time of imminent danger, the <hi>Major</hi> commandeth forth a party of Souldiers conducted by an able <hi>Officer</hi> to go firſt, and make diligent ſearch for diſcovering of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcadoes,</hi> which may happen to be in any cloſe ſuſpected places, as <hi>Lanes, By-ways, Hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> ruinous <hi>Cottages, Churches, Pits,</hi> or <hi>Hallow-trees, Woods, Gardens,</hi> and all ſuch like <hi>Incloſures,</hi> at which time he openeth not the <hi>Main-Ports,</hi> but only the <hi>Wickets.</hi> And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon command to the contrary which is not uſuall, both the <hi>Guards</hi> and the <hi>Watches</hi> at the <hi>Gates,</hi> are to be kept night and day, and all perſons upon them to continue upon their duty untill they ſhall be relieved by order.</p>
                  <p>Upon the diſcharging of the <hi>Watch,</hi> to the end, that every <hi>Officer</hi> and <hi>Souldier</hi> may have notice, to make ſpeedy repair to their ſeverall <hi>Guards,</hi> each ſeverall <hi>Drum</hi> firſt beats a <hi>Troop,</hi> and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And now, further, to ſatisfie the expectation of the Lovers of the <hi>Art Military,</hi> it ſhall not ſeem unſeaſonable here to declare ſomwhat concerning the manner of <hi>Field-Watches,</hi> or <hi>Vigils de Champe,</hi> denoted unto us by the <hi>Expert</hi> and <hi>Ancients,</hi> under theſe three No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

                  <p>They being ſummon'd by beat of the <hi>Drum,</hi> to meet at their uſually place of <hi>Randezvous,</hi> they may be drawn up according to the uſuall manner, having a <hi>Van-guard, Battail,</hi> and <hi>Reer-guard,</hi> being thus ordered, and each of the Souldiers having either in his <hi>hat</hi> a <hi>black feather,</hi> or <hi>ribbin,</hi> the <hi>Captain</hi> may draw them off, and order them to their <hi>long-march;</hi> moving them away in an orderly manner unto the place of him that is deceaſed, and there make <hi>Alt.</hi> After which he may command the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> in the <hi>Van</hi> to open to the right and left outward to ſuch convenient diſtance as the <hi>Pikes</hi> may move up between them, and take poſſeſſion of their firſt ground, and thoſe <hi>Muskettiers</hi> may <hi>face</hi> about, and move down cleer of the <hi>Pikes,</hi> and after cloſe their <hi>files</hi> inward to <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>face</hi> to their <hi>Leader.</hi>

After which, the <hi>Enſigne</hi> may put his <hi>colours</hi> upon his <hi>ſtaffe,</hi> and <hi>furle</hi> them up, then the <hi>Pikes</hi> may be drawn up again into one Body, and the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> into another, and falling in the <hi>Reer</hi> of the <hi>Pikes,</hi> they may <hi>troop</hi> away. And a little before the place of <hi>lodging</hi> the <hi>colours,</hi> they may make <hi>Alt,</hi> and the <hi>Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers</hi> may <hi>fleeve</hi> up by the out-ſide of the <hi>Pikes</hi> from the <hi>Reer filing</hi> to the right and left, making a <hi>Guard</hi> for the <hi>colours</hi> and <hi>pikes</hi> to <hi>march</hi> through them, and being cleer, and the <hi>colours lodged,</hi> they may <hi>face</hi> about again to the right, and give another <hi>volley</hi> of <hi>ſhot;</hi> but if there ſhould be ſuch aſtreight of ground, that the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> cannot be drawn into a <hi>Ring,</hi> then they muſt be otherwiſe diſpoſed of by making them into two <hi>ranks,</hi> the one on the one ſide of the <hi>Street,</hi> and the other of the other ſide, <hi>facing</hi> them either in oppoſition, or in an oblique manner; if in oppoſition, they muſt preſent very low, and give <hi>fire</hi> three times altogether as before, with one <hi>volley</hi> after another; if <hi>oblique,</hi> the one <hi>rank</hi> is to be <hi>faced</hi> towards the upper end of the <hi>Street,</hi> and the other towards the lower end, and ſo may <hi>fire</hi> with leſſe danger to each other, the <hi>Pikes</hi> to be <hi>ſiled</hi> away to the right and left, behinde the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> before they were thus <hi>faced.</hi> And again, where they have not length of ground to contrive the <hi>Muskettiers</hi> into two ſingle <hi>ranks,</hi> they may <hi>fire</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they ſtand at <hi>order, mounting</hi> up the <hi>Muzzels</hi> of their <hi>Muskets</hi> into the aire, without offending each other. Therefore according to the conveniency of the ground, it muſt be the diſcretion of every Commander to order his men accordingly to performe his three <hi>volleys</hi> of <hi>ſhot,</hi> in the moſt <hi>gracefulleſt</hi> way, which being ended they may all returne to their <hi>Quarters.</hi> And thus much may ſuffice for ſatisfaction to any Commander in orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſingle <hi>Company</hi> to any <hi>Funerall Occaſion, marching</hi> alone of it ſelfe.</p>
